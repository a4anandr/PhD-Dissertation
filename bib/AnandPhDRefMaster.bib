	abstract={Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example.},

This problem is governed by the filtering equation for the unnormalized conditional density with A * the forwarded operator Theorem: if then the fundamental solution of the filtering equation can be written explicity in terms of a small number of statistics satisfying a matrixvector equation. The Lie algebraic interpretation of this result is studied and described. Extensions to many dimensions and applications to optimal stochastic control readily follow. }

We examine the structure of the solution in 1D by reformulating the original problem into a contact problem which can be solved by dual optimization techniques. The solution turns out to be a 'smooth' discrete polynomial spline whose knots coincide with the contact points while its counterpart in the contact problem is a discrete version of a spline with higher defect and contact points as knots. In 2D we modify Chambolle's algorithm to solve the minimization problem with the ℓ1 norm of interacting second order partial derivatives as regularization term. We show that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently by applying the fast cosine transform. We demonstrate by numerical denoising examples that the ℓ2 gradient fitting term can be used to avoid both edge blurring and staircasing effects.",

	abstract="This paper concerns modeling and policy synthesis for regulation of multiclass queueing networks. A 2-parameter network model is introduced to allow independent modeling of variability and mean processing-rates, while maintaining simplicity of the model. Policy synthesis is based on consideration of more tractable workload models, and then translating a policy from this abstraction to the discrete network of interest. Translation is made possible through the use of safety-stocks that maintain feasibility of workload trajectories. This is a well-known approach in the queueing theory literature, and may be viewed as a generic approach to avoid deadlock in a discrete-event dynamical system. Simulation is used to evaluate a given policy, and to tune safety-stock levels. These simulations are accelerated through a variance reduction technique that incorporates stochastic approximation to tune the variance reduction. The search for appropriate safety-stock levels is coordinated through a cutting plane algorithm. Both the policy synthesis and the simulation acceleration rely heavily on the development of approximations to the value function through fluid model considerations.",

In this paper we present a detailed study of the dependence of the asymptotic variance on the deviation from reversibility. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical simulations.",

	abstract = { The present memoir is the outcome of an attempt to obtain the conditions under which a given symmetric and continuous function k(s, t) is definite, in the sense of Hilbert. At an early stage, however, it was found that the class of definite functions was too restricted to allow the determination of necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the determinants of § 10. The discovery that this could be done for functions of positive or negative type, and the fact that almost all the theorems which are true of definite functions are, with slight modification, true of these, led finally to the abandonment of the original plan in favour of a discussion of the properties of functions belonging to the wider classes. The first part of the memoir is devoted to the definition of various terms employed, and to the re-statement of the consequences which follow from Hilbert’s theorem. }

When convergence is less than exponential we show that it is often polynomial at verifiable rates. We then consider methods of discretizing the diffusion in time, and find methods which inherit the convergence rates of the continuous time process. These contrast with the behavior of the naive or Euler discretization, which can behave badly even in simple cases.

	abstract = {A new sequential data assimilation method is discussed. It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.},

	abstract = { Let B be a Banach space and (ℋ,‖·‖ℋ) be a dense, imbedded subspace. For a ∈ B, its distance to the ball of ℋ with radius R (denoted as I(a, R)) tends to zero when R tends to infinity. We are interested in the rate of this convergence. This approximation problem arose from the study of learning theory, where B is the L2 space and ℋ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The class of elements having I(a, R) = O(R-r) with r > 0 is an interpolation space of the couple (B, ℋ). The rate of convergence can often be realized by linear operators. In particular, this is the case when ℋ is the range of a compact, symmetric, and strictly positive definite linear operator on a separable Hilbert space B. For the kernel approximation studied in Learning Theory, the rate depends on the regularity of the kernel function. This yields error estimates for the approximation by reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. When the kernel is smooth, the convergence is slow and a logarithmic convergence rate is presented for analytic kernels in this paper. The purpose of our results is to provide some theoretical estimates, including the constants, for the approximation error required for the learning theory. }

We give estimates for this covering number by means of the regularity of the Mercer kernel K. For convolution type kernels K(x,t)=k(x−t) on [0,1]n, we provide estimates depending on the decay of k̂, the Fourier transform of k. In particular, when k̂ decays exponentially, our estimate for this covering number is better than all the previous results and covers many important Mercer kernels. A counter example is presented to show that the eigenfunctions of the Hilbert–Schmidt operator LmK associated with a Mercer kernel K may not be uniformly bounded. Hence some previous methods used for estimating the covering number in Learning Theory are not valid. We also provide an example of a Mercer kernel to show that LK1/2 may not be generated by a Mercer kernel."

	Abstract = {We consider a supply function model of a poolco electricity market where demand varies significantly over a time horizon such as a day and also has a small responsiveness to price. Although there are equilibria yielding prices at peak that are close to Cournot prices, it is known that the wider the range of demand uncertainty the narrower the range of such supply function equilibria. Here we show that such equilibria are also typically unstable and consequently would be difficult to sustain in practice. This strengthens the results of Green and Newbery by ruling out many equilibria that have high prices. We demonstrate this result both theoretically under somewhat restrictive assumptions and also numerically using both a three-firm example system and a five-firm example system having generation capacity constraints. Hence, this reinforces the conclusion that the market outcome is significantly influenced by a requirement that offers into the poolco be consistent over the time horizon. This result contrasts with markets where bids can be changed on an hourly basis, where Cournot prices are possible outcomes. The stability analysis has important policy implications for the design of day-ahead electricity markets. The stability perspective also provides a narrowing of the equilibrium selection that strengthens empirical analysis.},

These costs are external to the coal industry and are thus often considered ``externalities.'' We estimate that the life cycle effects of coal and the waste stream generated are costing the U.S. public a third to over one-half of a trillion dollars annually. Many of these so-called externalities are, moreover, cumulative. Accounting for the damages conservatively doubles to triples the price of electricity from coal per kWh generated, making wind, solar, and other forms of nonfossil fuel power generation, along with investments in efficiency and electricity conservation methods, economically competitive. We focus on Appalachia, though coal is mined in other regions of the United States and is burned throughout the world.},

	Major recent changes in electricity markets relate to the process for their deregulation, along with increasing participation of renewable (stochastic) generation e.g. wind power. Our general objective is to model how feedback, competition and stochasticity (on the production side) interact in electricity markets, and eventually assess what their effects are on both the participants and the society. For this, day ahead electricity markets are modeled as dynamic closed loop systems, in which the feedback signal is the market price. In parallel, the Cournot competition model is considered. Mixed portfolios with significant share of renewable energy are based on stochastic threshold cost functions. Regarding trading strategies, it is assumed that generators are looking at optimizing their individual profits. The point of view of the society is addressed by analyzing market behavior and stability. The performed simulations show the beneficial effects of employing long term bidding strategies for both generators and society. Sensitivity analyses are performed in order to evaluate the effects of demand elasticity. It is shown that increase in demand elasticity reduces the possibility for the generators to exploit their market power. Furthermore, the results suggest that introduction of wind power generation in the market is beneficial both for the generators and the society.},

	Abstract = { We consider decentralized congestion control algorithms for low-loss operation of the Internet using the ECN bit. There has been much analysis of such algorithms, but with a few exceptions, these typically ignore the effect of feedback delays in the network on stability. We study a single node with many flows passing through it, with each flow (possibly) having a different round-trip delay. Using a fluid model for the flows, we show that even with delays, the total data rate at the router is bounded; and this bound shows that the (peak) total rate grows linearly with increase in system size, i.e., the fraction of overprovisioning required is constant with respect to N, the number of flows in the system. Further, for typical user data rates and delays seen in the Internet today, the bound is very close to the data rate at the router without delays. Earlier results by Johari and Tan have given conditions for a linearized model of the network to be (locally) stable. We show that even when the linearized model is not stable, the nonlinear model is upper bounded, i.e., the total rate at the bottleneck link is upper bounded, and the upper bound is close to the equilibrium rate for TCP.},

	Abstract = { We study different notions of capacity for time-slotted ALOHA systems. In these systems, multiple users synchronously send packets in a bursty manner over a common additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The users do not coordinate their transmissions, which may collide at the receiver. For such a system, we define both single-slot capacity and multiple-slot capacity. We then construct a coding and decoding scheme for single-slot capacity that achieves any rate within this capacity region. This coding and decoding scheme for a single time slot combines aspects of multiple access rate splitting and of broadcast codes for degraded AWGN channels. This design allows some bits to be reliably received even when collisions occur and more bits to be reliably received in the absence of collisions. The exact number of bits reliably received under both of these scenarios is part of the code design process, which we optimize to maximize the expected rate in each slot. Next, we examine the behavior of the system asymptotically over multiple slots. We show that there exist coding and decoding strategies such that regardless of the burstiness of the traffic, the system is stable as long as the average rate of the users is within the multiple access capacity region of the channel. In other words, we show that bursty traffic does not decrease the Cover-Wyner capacity region of the multiple access channel. A vast family of codes, which includes the type of codes we introduce for the single-slot transmission, achieve the capacity region, in a sense we define, for multiple-slot transmissions. These codes are stabilizing, using only local information at each of the individual queues. The use of information regarding other queues or the use of scheduling does not improve the multiple-slot capacity region.},

	Abstract = {While renewable resources most certainly provide environmental benefits, and also help to meet aggressive renewable energy targets, their deployment has pronounced impacts on system operations. There is an acute need to understand these impacts in order to fully harness the benefits of renewable resource integration. In this paper we focus on the integration of wind energy resources in a multi-settlement electricity market structure. We study the dynamic competitive equilibrium for a stochastic market model, and obtain closed form expressions for the supplier and consumer surpluses. Numerical results based on these formulae show that the value of wind generation to consumers, under the current operational practices, falls dramatically with volatility. In fact, we can establish thresholds for the coefficient of variation beyond which the value of wind is questionable. These findings emphasize the need to investigate operational schemes that address volatility.},

	Abstract = {The focus of this work is on the analysis of transmit beamforming schemes with a low-rate feedback link in wireless sensor/relay networks, where nodes in the network need to implement beamforming in a distributed manner. Specifically, the problem of distributed phase alignment is considered, where neither the transmitters nor the receiver has perfect channel state information, but there is a low-rate feedback link from the receiver to the transmitters. In this setting, a framework is proposed for systematically analyzing the performance of distributed beamforming schemes. To illustrate the advantage of this framework, a simple adaptive distributed beamforming scheme that was recently proposed by Mudambai et al. is studied. Two important properties of the received signal magnitude function are derived. Using these properties and the systematic framework, it is shown that the adaptive distributed beamforming scheme converges both in probability and in mean. Furthermore, it is established that the time required for the adaptive scheme to converge in mean scales linearly with respect to the number of sensor/relay nodes.},

@book{goy07,
	Abstract = {Networks pervade social and economic life, and they play a prominent role in explaining a huge variety of social and economic phenomena. Standard economic theory did not give much credit to the role of networks until the early 1990s, but since then the study of the theory of networks has blossomed. At the heart of this research is the idea that the pattern of connections between individual rational agents shapes their actions and determines their rewards. The importance of connections has in turn motivated the study of the very processes by which networks are formed.
	
	In \emph{Connections}, Sanjeev Goyal puts contemporary thinking about networks and economic activity into context. He develops a general framework within which this body of research can be located. In the first part of the book he demonstrates that location in a network has significant effects on individual rewards and that, given this, it is natural that individuals will seek to form connections to move the network in their favor. This idea motivates the second part of the book, which develops a general theory of network formation founded on individual incentives. Goyal assesses the robustness of current research findings and identifies the substantive open questions. Written in a style that combines simple examples with formal models and complete mathematical proofs, Connections is a concise and self-contained treatment of the economic theory of networks, one that should become the natural source of reference for graduate students in economics and related disciplines.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the sensor-utility-network (SUN) method for occupancy estimation in buildings. Based on inputs from a variety of sensor measurements, along with historical data regarding building utilization, the SUN estimator produces occupancy estimates through the solution of a receding-horizon convex optimization problem. State-of-the-art on-line occupancy algorithms rely on indirect measurements, such as CO2 levels, or people counting sensors which are subject to significant errors and cost. The newly proposed method was evaluated via experiments in an office building environment. Estimation accuracy is shown to improve significantly when all available data is incorporated in the estimator. In particular, it is found that the average estimation error at the building level is reduced from 70\%\  to 11\%\ using the SUN estimator, when compared to the naive approach that relies solely on flow measurements.},

The approach combines adaptive modulation with network utility maximization. We extend the approach to find optimal source rates and transmitter power and rate policies without explicit knowledge of the distribution of channel states. These optimal power and rate policies balance delay (backlog), transmission rate and energy to maximize network performance under constraints on average transmitter power and link buffer arrival and departure rates. Explicit policies are found for single links, and algorithmic methods presented to find optimal policies for complex interfering networks.},

If one can observe increments but does not know their probabilistic properties, what are the statistical limits of estimating the tail exponent of Loynes' distribution? We conjecture that in broad generality a consistent sequence of non-parametric estimators can be constructed that satisfies a large deviation principle. We present rigorous support for this conjecture under restrictive assumptions and simulation evidence indicating why we believe it to be true in greater generality.},

	Abstract = {We consider a K-dimensional diffusion process Z whose state space is the nonnegative orthant. On the interior of the orthant, Z behaves like a K-dimensional Brownian motion with arbitrary covariance matrix and drift vector. At each of the (`K-1) dimensional hyperplanes that form the boundary of the orthant, Z reflects instantaneously in a direction that is constant over that hyperplane. There is no extant theory of multidimensional diffusion that applies to this process, because the boundary of its state space is not smooth. We adopt an approach that requires a restriction on the directions of reflection, but Reiman has shown that this restriction is met by all diffusions Z arising as heavy traffic limits in open K-station queuing networks. Our process Z is defined as a path-to-path mapping of K-dimensional Brownian motion. From this construction it follows that Z is a continuous Markov process and a semimartingale. Using the latter property, we obtain a change of variable formula from which one can develop a complete analytical theory for the process Z.},

	Abstract = {An achievable region is derived for the multiple-access channel under decoding mismatch conditions. It is shown that achievable rates higher than the random coding capacity of the single-user mismatched channel can sometimes be demonstrated by treating the single-user channel as a multiple-access channel. Refining these ideas we derive a lower bound on the capacity of the mismatched single-user channel, which is tighter than previously published bounds. Using this bound, we are able to answer in the negative the question raised by Csiszar and Narayan (see ibid., vol.41, no.1, p.35, 1995) as to whether equality between the mismatch capacity and the matched capacity implies that the random coding lower bound to the mismatch capacity is tight},

	Abstract = {Population learning in dynamic economies traditionally has been studied in contexts where payoff landscapes are smooth. Here, dynamic population games take place over `rugged' landscapes, where agents are uncertain about payoffs from bilateral interactions. Notably, individual payoffs from playing a binary action against everyone else are uniformly distributed over $[0,1]$. This random population game leads the population to adapt over time, with agents updating both actions and partners. Agents evaluate payoffs associated to networks thanks to simple statistics of the distributions of payoffs associated to all combinations of actions performed by agents out of the interaction set. Simulations show that: (1) allowing for endogenous networks implies higher average payoff compared to static networks; (2) the statistics used to evaluate payoffs affect convergence to steady-state; and (3) for statistics MIN or MAX, the likelihood of efficient population learning strongly depends on whether agents are change-averse or not in discriminating between options delivering the same expected payoff.},

	Abstract = {
	A risk analysis tool is developed for computation of the distributions of fire model output variables. The tool, called Probabilistic Fire Simulator (PFS), combines Monte Carlo simulation and CFAST, a two-zone fire model. In this work, the tool is used to estimate the failure probability of redundant cables in a cable tunnel fire, and the failure and smoke filling probabilities in an electronics room during an electronics cabinet fire. Sensitivity of the output variables to the input variables is calculated in terms of the rank order correlations. The use of the rank order correlations allows the user to identify both modelling parameters and actual facility properties that have the most influence on the results. Various steps of the simulation process, i.e. data collection, generation of the input distributions, modelling assumptions, definition of the output variables and the actual simulation, are described.},

	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with modeling, analysis and optimization/control of occupancy evolution in a large building. The main concern is efficient evacuation of a building in the event of threat or emergency. Complexity arises from the curse of dimensionality in a large building, as well as the uncertain and nonlinear dynamics of individuals. In this paper we propose relaxation techniques borrowed from queueing theory to address complexity. Then we provide tools to model occupancy evolution during egress, obtain lower bounds on evacuation time, and construct control solutions to instruct occupants in order to efficiently evacuate the building. The control solutions are based on recent generalizations of the MaxWeight policy for decentralized routing. These results are illustrated with the aid of simulations carried out using realistic building models.},

Three examples are considered: a pair of tandem queues; a simple routing model; and the Dai-Wang re-entrant line. In each case, a single policy is proposed that is independent of network load ÏÂ·. The following conclusions are obtained for the controlled network, where the finite constant K0 is independent of load.

	Abstract = {For {Markov} sources, the structure of optimal causal encoders minimizing the total communication rate subject to a mean-square distortion constraint is studied. The class of sources considered lives in a continuous alphabet, and the encoder is allowed to be variable-rate. Both the finite-horizon and the infinite-horizon problems are considered. In the finite-horizon case, the problem is non-convex, whereas in the infinite-horizon case the problem can be convexified under certain assumptions. For a finite horizon problem, the optimal deterministic causal encoder for a kth-order {Markov} source uses only the most recent k source symbols and the information available at the receiver, whereas the optimal causal coder for a memoryless source is memoryless. For the infinite-horizon problem, a convex-analytic approach is adopted. Randomized stationary quantizers are suboptimal in the absence of common randomness between the encoder and the decoder. If there is common randomness, the optimal quantizer requires the randomization of at most two deterministic quantizers. In the absence of common randomness, the optimal quantizer is non-stationary and a recurrence-based time-sharing of two deterministic quantizers is optimal. A linear source driven by Gaussian noise is considered. If the process is stable, innovation coding is almost optimal at high-rates, whereas if the source is unstable, then even a high-rate time-invariant innovation coding scheme leads to an unstable estimation process.},

The work is motivated in part by the need for reduced order estimation of occupancy in a building during evacuation. We propose and compare two distinct model reduction techniques, each of which is based on the potential matrix for the {Markov} semigroup. The first method is based on spectral graph partitioning where the weights are defined by the entries of the potential matrix. The second approach is based on aggregating states with similar long term uncertainty, where uncertainty is captured using conditional entropy. It is shown that entropy can be conveniently expressed in terms of the potential matrix. In application to the building model, the entries of the potential matrix correspond to the mean time an individual occupies a given cell. Numerical results are described, including a simulation study of the reduced order estimator.},

This conclusion holds for both the competitive equilibrium market model, and the monopolistic market model. (ii) The long-run average price in the competitive model is always greater than the marginal cost, but less than the long-run average cost in the monopolistic model.

The state-of-the-art max-pressure algorithms have provably optimal stability properties but in networks with cycles and loops the delay performance can be quite poor at rates that are not very close to the capacity region boundary. We propose a new scheduling and routing policy to try to address this that results in serving the longest queue but routing packets along (dynamic) shortest-path routes. For a two-node relay we prove stability for our policy using fluid limits.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the fluid approximation (also known as the functional strong law of large numbers) and the stability (positive Harris recurrence) for a multiclass queueing network. Both of these are related to the stabilities of a linear fluid model, constructed from the first-order parameters (i.e., long-run average arrivals, services and routings) of the queueing network. It is proved that the fluid approximation for the queueing network exists if the corresponding linear fluid model is weakly stable, and that the queueing network is stable if the corresponding linear fluid model is (strongly) stable. Sufficient conditions are found for the stabilities of a linear fluid model.

	Abstract = {We consider a {Markov}ian model of a multiclass queueing system in which a single large pool of servers attends to the various customer classes. Customers waiting to be served may abandon the queue, and there is a cost penalty associated with such abandonments. Service rates, abandonment rates, and abandonment penalties are generally different for the different classes. The problem studied is that of dynamically scheduling the various classes. We consider the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime, where the total arrival rate and the number of servers both become large in such a way that the system's traffic intensity parameter approaches one. An approximating diffusion control problem is described and justified as a purely formal (that is, nonrigorous) heavy traffic limit. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the limiting diffusion control problem is shown to have a smooth (classical) solution, and optimal controls are shown to have an extremal or "bang-bang" character. Several useful qualitative insights are derived from the mathematical analysis, including a "square-root rule" for sizing large systems and a sharp contrast between system behavior in the Halfin-Whitt regime versus that observed in the "conventional" heavy traffic regime. The latter phenomenon is illustrated by means of a numerical example having two customer classes.},

	A theoretical result is proved, strongly evocative of nonnegative supermartingales. Application is made to the "shortest queue" problem, a problem with an extensive literature, which, in its simplest form, is concerned with the characteristics of a two-server, two-queue queueing system where customers join the shortest queue. In an $N$-server environment it is shown that joining the shortest queue can bound the expected sum of the squares of differences between all queue state pairs, a result which holds under arbitrarily heavy traffic.

	Annote = { In this paper, the authors consider a single-server system with $N$ classes of users. The problem considered is that of quality of service. The largest weighted delay first (LWDF) discipline, which is parametrized by the weight vector $\left(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_N\right)$, is introduced. It is assumed that the input flows have stationary increments and satisfy a sample path large deviation principle, and the system is stable. It is shown that, under the LWDF discipline, the sequence of scaled distributions of the delay of each flow satisfies a large-deviation principle, where the rate function is given in terms of a finite-dimensional optimization problem. Large-deviation techniques are utilized in the proofs. In much earlier work, a policy was fixed a priori, and the emphasis was then on performance analysis. In this work, a desired performance objective is fixed and the focus is on determining the policy that is best suited to achieve it.

	Abstract = {The computer-assisted modeling of re-entrant production lines, and, in particular, simulation scalability, is attracting a lot of attention due to the importance of such lines in semiconductor manufacturing. Re-entrant flows lead to competition for processing capacity among the items produced, which significantly impacts their throughput time (TPT). Such production models naturally exhibit two time scales: a short one, characteristic of single items processed through individual machines, and a longer one, characteristic of the response time of the entire factory. Coarse-grained partial differential equations for the spatio-temporal evolution of a "phase density" were obtained through a kinetic theory approach in Armbruster et al. [2]. We take advantage of the time scale separation to directly solve such coarse-grained equations, even when we cannot derive them explicitly, through an equation-free computational approach. Short bursts of appropriately initialized stochastic fine-scale simulation are used to perform coarse projective integration on the phase density. The key step in this process is lifting: the construction of fine-scale, discrete realizations consistent with a given coarse-grained phase density field. We achieve this through computational evaluation of conditional distributions of a "phase velocity" at the limit of large item influxes. },

	Abstract = {In a recent paper  (Gamarnik and Zeevi, Ann. App. Prob. (2006)) it was shown that under
	suitable conditions stationary distributions of the   (scaled) queue lengths
	process for a generalized Jackson network   converge to the stationary distribution of the associated
	reflected Brownian motion in the heavy traffic limit. The proof relied on certain exponential
	integrability assumptions on the primitives of the network. In this
	note we provide an alternative proof of this result that does not
	require exponential integrability. The conditions that we impose (in
	addition to natural heavy traffic and stability assumptions) are   precisely the i.i.d. and square integrability
	assumptions on the network primitives that are typically made in heavy traffic analysis.

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of optimal control of pull manufacturing systems. We study a fluid model of a flow shop, with buffer holding costs non-decreasing along the route. The system is subject to a constant exogenous demand, thus incurring additional shortfall/inventory costs. The objective is to determine the optimal control for the production rate at each machine in the system. We exhibit a decomposition of the flow shop into sections of contiguous machines, where, in each section, the  machine is the bottleneck for the downstream system.
	We exhibit the form of an optimal control, and show that it is characterized by a set of deferral times, one for each head machine. Machines which are upstream of a head machine simply adopt a  just-in-time production policy. The head machines initially
	stay idle for a period equal to their deferral time, and thereafter produce as fast as
	possible, until the initial shortfall is eliminated. The optimal values of these deferral
	times are simply obtained by solving a set of quadratic programming problems. 
	We also exhibit special cases of re-entrant lines, for which the optimal control is
	similarly computable. },

The channel is assumed to be fixed for all transmissions over the period of interest and the ratio of anticipated average arrival rates for the two users, also known as the relative traffic rate, is the system design parameter. A packet-based traffic model is considered where data for each user is queued at the transmit end. A queueing analogue for this system leads to a coupled queueing system for which a simple policy is known to be throughput-optimal under {Markov}ian assumptions. Since an exact expression for the performance is not available, as a measure of performance (in heavy traffic), a diffusion approximation is established. This diffusion process is a two-dimensional semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion living in the positive quadrant of two-dimensional space. },

	Abstract = {A version of dynamic programming, which computes level sets of the value function rather than the value function set itself, is used to design robust non-linear controllers for linear, discrete-time, dynamical systems subject to hard constraints on controls and states. The controller stabilizes the system and steers all trajectories emanating in a prescribed set to a control invariant set in minimum time. For the robust regulator problem, the control invariant terminal set is a neighborhood, preferably small, of the origin; for the robust tracking problem, the control invariant terminal set is a neighborhood of the invariant set in which the tracking error is zero. Two non-linear controllers which utilize the level sets of the value function, are described. The first requires the controller to solve, on-line, a modest linear program whose dimension is approximately the same as that of the control variable. The second decomposes each level set into a set of simplices; a piecewise linear control law, affine in each simplex, is then constructed.},

	Abstract = {"For discrete memoryless channels $\{W\colon X\to Y\}$, we consider decoders, possibly suboptimal, which minimize a metric defined additively by a given function $d(x,y)\geq 0$. The largest rate achievable by codes with such a decoder is called the $d$-capacity $C_d(W)$. The choice $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $W(y|x)>0$ makes $C_d(W)$ equal to the `zero undetected error' or `erasures-only' capacity $C_{\rm eo}(W)$. The graph-theoretic concepts of Shannon capacity and Sperner capacity are also special cases of $d$-capacity, viz. for a noiseless channel with a suitable $\{0,1\}$-valued function $d$.
	
	"We show that the lower bound on $d$-capacity given previously by Csisz{\'a}r and K{\"o}rner and by Hui, is not tight in general, but $C_d(W)>0$ iff this bound is positive. The `product space' improvement of the lower bound is considered, and a `product space characterization' of $C_{\rm eo}(W)$ is obtained. We also determine the erasures-only capacity of a deterministic arbitrarily varying channel defined by a bipartite graph, and show that it equals capacity. We conclude with a list of challenging open problems."},

The dual channels we consider have the same channel gains and the same noise power at all receivers.

We can use this result to find the capacity region of the MAC if the capacity region of only the BC is known, and vice versa. For fading channels we show duality under ergodic capacity, but duality also holds for different capacity definitions for fading channels such as outage capacity and minimum-rate capacity. Using duality, many results known for only one of the two channels can be extended to the dual channel as well.},

	Abstract = { The authors consider queueing systems where the "workload process" $(W_t; t\geq 0)$ satisfies a large deviation asymptotic, i.e., $\lim_{\to\infty}v^{-1}_t\log P(W_t/a_t>w)=-I(w)$ with suitable scaling functions $(a_t,v_t; t\geq 0)$ and a rate function $I$. It turns out that, under suitable hypotheses, the tail probabilities of the "queue-length" $Q=\sup_{t\geq 0}W_t$ decay like $P(Q>b)\sim\exp\{-\delta v(a^{-1}(b))\}$ (as $b\to\infty$), where $\delta$ is related to the rate function $I$, and $a^{-1}$ denotes the generalized inverse of $a$. So, the queue-length distribution has an exponential tail only if $a_t/v_t$ tends to a finite and strictly positive limit as $t\to\infty$.
	
	Some applications are discussed, including fractional Brownian motion and, more generally, Gaussian processes with stationary increments. Finally, a non-Gaussian example is considered in which the arrivals are modelled by a squared Bessel process.},

We give a framework for using this method that unifies results obtained for different models. We also give a comprehensive overview of the results that can be obtained through it, in which we discuss not only (partial) characterizations of optimal policies but also applications of monotonicity to optimization problems and comparisons of systems.},

	Abstract = {In wireless data networks, the optimal routing of data depends on the link capacities which, in turn, are determined by the allocation of communications resources (such as transmit powers and bandwidths) to the links. The optimal performance of the network can only be achieved by simultaneous optimization of routing and resource allocation. In this paper, we formulate the simultaneous routing and resource allocation (SRRA) problem, and exploit problem structure to derive efficient solution methods. We use a capacitated multicommodity flow model to describe the data flows in the network. We assume that the capacity of a wireless link is a concave and increasing function of the communications resources allocated to the link, and the communications resources for groups of links are limited. These assumptions allow us to formulate the SRRA problem as a convex optimization problem over the network flow variables and the communications variables. These two sets of variables are coupled only through the link capacity constraints. We exploit this separable structure by dual decomposition. The resulting solution method attains the optimal coordination of data routing in the network layer and resource allocation in the radio control layer via pricing on the link capacities.},

	Abstract = {Consider a network $G=(V,E)$ such that each vertex $i$ has a supply $\gamma_i$ and each edge $(i,j)$ has a capacity $u_{ij}$. A transshipment over time that completes by time $T$ is a time-dependent flow $f\colon \{1, 2, \dots , T\}\rightarrow\bold R$ through the network such that $f_{ij}(t) \leq u_{ij}$ for $1\leq t\leq T$, $\sum_{t=1}^r\sum_{j}(f_{ij}(t) -f_{ji}(t)) \leq \max(0,\gamma_i)$ for $1\leq r \leq T$ and $i\in V$, and $\sum_{t=1}^T\sum_{j}(f_{ij}(t) -f_{ji}(t)) = \gamma_i$ for $i \in V$. The quickest transshipment problem is a transshipment over time with smallest $T$. In this paper, the author proposes an algorithm which computes a quickest transshipment using a polynomial number of maximum flow computations. When there is only one sink, the algorithm requires only $O(k)$ maximum flow computations, where $k$ is the number of sources.},

Also, if the unbounded service time is non-lattice, then the stationary distribution is also unique. The proofs use ergodic techniques for {Markov} processes with continuous state spaces.

	Abstract = {Telephone call centers are an integral part of many businesses, and their economic role is significant and growing. They are also fascinating socio-technical systems in which the behavior of customers and employees is closely intertwined with physical performance measures. In these environments traditional operational models are of great value -- and at the same time fundamentally limited -- in their ability to characterize system performance.
	We review the state of research on telephone call centers. We begin with a tutorial on how call centers function and proceed to survey academic research devoted to the management of their operations. We then outline important problems that have not been addressed and identify promising directions for future research.},

Few assumptions are made on the arrival process statistics other than the assumption that their mean values lie within the capacity region and that they satisfy a version of the law of large numbers. We prove that, for any mean arrival rate that lies in the capacity region, the queues will be stable under our policy. Moreover, we show that it is easy to incorporate imperfect queue length information and other approximations that can simplify the implementation of our policy.

	Abstract = {
	Suppose that we sequentially place $n$ balls into $n$ boxes by putting each ball into a randomly chosen box. It is well known that when we are done, the fullest box has with high probability\break $(1+o(1))\ln n/\ln \ln n$ balls in it. Suppose instead that for each ball we choose two boxes at random and place the ball into the one which is less full at the time of placement. The authors show that with high probability, the fullest box contains only $\ln \ln n/\ln 2+O(1)$ balls---exponentially less than before. Furthermore, they show that a similar gap exists in the infinite process, where at each step one ball, chosen uniformly at random, is deleted, and one ball is added in the manner described above. They discuss consequences of this and related theorems for dynamic resource allocation, hashing, and on-line load balancing.

	Summary: "This paper extends the fundamental queueing relations $L=\lambda W$ and $H=\lambda G$ that relate customer averages (the customer-average waiting time $W$ or cost $G$) to associated time averages (the time-average queue length $L$ or cost $H$) given an arrival process with arrival rate $\lambda$. These relations can be established by focusing attention on a two-dimensional cumulative input process that has the two one-dimensional cumulative input processes of interest as marginals. Relations between the marginal averages are established for cumulative input processes that may not be representable as integrals or sums. The general framework includes the continuous versions of $L=\lambda W$ and $H=\lambda G$ due to \n T. Rolski\en and \n S. Stidham\en as well as the standard version of $H=\lambda G$, and can be extended to higher dimensions. Inequalities are also established when some of the conditions for equality do not hold. Moreover, central limit theorem versions of $H=\lambda G$ are established, extending our recent results for $L=\lambda W$."},

	Summary: "Necessary and sufficient conditions are established for cumulative processes (associated with regenerative processes) to obey several classical limit theorems, e.g., a strong law of large numbers, a law of the iterated logarithm and a functional central limit theorem. The key random variables are the integral of the regenerative process over one cycle and the supremum of the absolute value of this integral over all possible initial segments of a cycle. The tail behavior of the distribution of the second random variable determines whether the cumulative process obeys the same limit theorem as the partial sums of the cycle integrals. Interesting open problems are the necessary conditions for the weak law of large numbers and the ordinary central limit theorem."

	Abstract = {Consider a standard single-server queue with a buffer of infinite capacity and first-in first-out service discipline. However, unlike a $GI/G/1$ queue there is no independence assumption regarding the interarrival and service times. It is only assumed that the sequence of service times minus interarrival times is stationary. In addition, the cumulant-generating function of the partial sum of the above stationary sequence satisfies the G{\"a}rtner-Ellis condition. In such a general setting the logarithmic asymptotics for the tail of the waiting time and queue length are derived, that is, it is shown that $\theta^*>0$ exists such that $x^{-1}\log {\rm Pr}\{W>x\}\to -\theta^*$, where $W$ is the steady-state waiting time. Several generalizations and examples are considered in some detail. In particular, an example is constructed to show that the above conditions are sufficient but not necessary for the logarithmic asymptotics. In summary, this generalizes an old result of Feller and his followers where a single-server queue with the independence assumption was treated in a fairly detailed manner.

	Abstract = {
	Suppose that $\{T(t)\}$ is an increasing process in $t$, with inverse process $N(s)= \inf\{t\colon T(t)>s \}$. The discussion here is mainly in terms of an increasing sequence of random variables, $\{T(n)\}$, when $N$ is the corresponding counting process. G\"{a}rtner-Ellis large deviation theory allows the asymptotics, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, of $\log P(t^{-1}T(t) \in A)$ to be deduced from the convergence of the logarithmic moment generating function $t^{-1} \log E \exp( \theta T(t))$ to a limit satisfying suitable conditions. This paper shows that such large deviation results hold for $T$ and $N$ together, in the sense that if the result holds for one it holds for the other. The paper goes on to show that in some circumstances the large deviation theory will apply to the counting process $N$ when it has an embedded regenerative structure. The immediate motivation for the work is provided by queueing theory.

The first three families are single-station systems operating under first-in--first-out (FIFO), generalized-head-of-the-line proportional processor sharing (GHLPPS) and static buffer priority (SBP) service disciplines. The next two families are reentrant lines that operate under first-buffer--first-serve (FBFS) and last-buffer--first-serve (LBFS) service disciplines; the last family consists of certain two-station, five-class networks operating under an SBP service discipline. Some of these heavy traffic limits have appeared earlier in the literature; our new proofs demonstrate the significant simplifications that can be achieved in the present setting."

This important synthesis problem has received little attention in the literature, and contrasts with the common analytical approach to the study of service systems. This latter approach contributes only indirectly to the problem of finding satisfactory scheduling rules when the desired (or required) response-time performance is known in advance. Briefly, the model studied assumes a {Markov} queueing system with M (priority) classes of jobs. For each class, a desired mean waiting time is given in advance. Making use of a well known conservation law, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a scheduling strategy that achieves the desired performance. We also give a constructive procedure for checking the condition and, if a solution exists, a procedure for finding one such strategy. Our assumptions are discussed and the possibility of relaxing them is explored.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents models, algorithms and analysis for measurement-based admission control in network applications in which there is high uncertainty concerning source statistics. In the process it extends and unifies several recent approaches to admission control. A new class of algorithms is introduced based on results concerning {Markov}'s canonical distributions. In addition, a new model is developed for the evolution of the number of flows in the admission control system. Performance evaluation is done through both analysis and simulation. Results show that the proposed algorithms minimize buffer-overflow probability among the class of all moment-consistent algorithms},

	This paper is devoted to a study of the integral of the workload process of the single server queue, in particular during one busy period. Firstly, we find asymptotics of the area A swept under the workload process W(t) during the busy period when the service time distribution has a regularly varying tail. We also investigate the case of a light-tailed service time distribution. Secondly, we consider the problem of obtaining an explicit expression for the distribution of A. In the general GI/G/1 case, we use a sequential approximation to find the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of A. In the M/M/1 case, this transform is obtained explicitly in terms of Whittaker functions. Thirdly, we consider moments of A in the GI/G/1 queue. Finally, we show asymptotic normality of

@article{kin62a,
	Abstract = { Queueing theory, which has endured a long period in which people treated one example after another, is finally breaking out of its confinement to independent arrivals, service times, etc. The present paper represents a significant step in that direction. The author considers a single-server queue in heavy traffic, i.e., traffic intensity close to 1, or more properly a small value of $\alpha=-E(u)/\text{Var}\,(u)$, where $u=s-t$ is the difference between the service times and the interarrival times chosen here to be stationary but not necessarily independent. The object is to show that for $\alpha\rightarrow 0$, the waiting time $w$ times $\alpha$ typically has a limit distribution which is exponential with mean $\frac 1{2}$. This is proved first for independent arrivals and service times with mild restrictions on their distributions and then extended to a class of inputs for which the arrivals differ from a renewal process by (dependent) random variables dominated by one with a finite second moment. The results are shown to be applicable to tandem queues and scheduled arrivals. In fact, the theorems, or rather obvious extensions of them, can be made to apply to most of the common queueing type problems where one is sufficiently close to the critical intensity.

	Abstract = {This paper proves that the stability region of a 2-station, 5-class re-entrant queueing network, operating under a non-preemptive static buffer priority service policy, depends on the distributions of the interarrival and service times. In particular, our result shows that conditions on the mean interarrival and service times are not enough to determine the stability of a queueing network, under a particular policy. We prove that when all distributions are exponential, the network is unstable in the sense that, with probability one, the total number of jobs in the network goes to infinity with time. We show that the same network with all interarrival and service
	times being deterministic is stable. When all distributions are uniform with a given range, our
	simulation studies show that the stability of the network depends on the width of the uniform distribution. Finally, we show that the same network, with deterministic interarrival and service
	times, is unstable when it is operated under the preemptive version of the static buffer priority
	service policy. Thus, our examples also demonstrate that the stability region depends on the
	preemption mechanism used.

	From the summary: "An algorithm is defined for establishing routing tables in the individual nodes of a data network. The routing table at a node $i$ specifies, for each other node $j$, what fraction of the traffic destined for node $j$ should leave node $i$ on each of the links emanating from node $i$. The algorithm is applied independently at each node and successively updates the routing table at that node based on information communicated between adjacent nodes about the marginal delay to each destination. For stationary input traffic statistics, the average delay per message through the network converges, with successive updates of the routing tables, to the minimum average delay over all routing assignments. The algorithm has the additional property that the traffic to each destination is guaranteed to be loop-free at each iteration of the algorithm. In addition, a new global convergence theorem for noncontinuous iteration algorithms is developed."},

@book{new82,
	Abstract = { The book appears to be a good supplement to the existing literature on the theory of queues. Though the book seems to have been primarily written for the engineering students taking courses in transportation theory, others interested in inventory control, dam theory, etc., are likely to derive benefit from it. The novel feature of the book which makes it different from other books on queues is that customers are assumed to be continuous fluid and discussion of such an assumption is achieved by using the classical fluid and diffusion approximations.
	
	The emphasis has been mainly on the approximate solutions of time-dependent behaviour of the queues. The author, while suggesting these approaches and discussing the mathematical analysis of some hypothetical queueing problems, has not, unfortunately, considered solutions to some real world queueing processes. Inclusion of solutions of some problems of the latter type would have enhanced the value of the theory proposed by the author in this book. It should also be pointed out that the method suggested would not apply to all queueing problems as stated by the author in Chapter 8 of the book.
	
	The description, by chapters, may be given as follows: The first introductory chapter discusses the graphs of arrival and departure processes and some nomenclature. The second chapter discusses the approximation of a discrete random variable (such as number of arrivals or departures) by a continuous random variable (such as fluid) and ends with examples of applications. The third chapter deals with multi-channel queues, tandem queues, queues concerning optimal priorities and some cost analysis. The fourth chapter, after discussing the binomial and Poisson distributions and their approximation by the normal distribution, discusses the estimation problems connected with arrival, departure and other related processes. The classical steady-state queueing models such as $M/M/1$, $M/M/s$ and $M/M/\infty$ are discussed in Chapter 5, whereas Chapters 6 and 7 analyze more properties of the steady-state and time-dependent queues by further exploiting the partial differential equations of the diffusion type and its approximations. The book ends with Chapter 8 which contains a discussion of some neglected problems. },

It is shown that the invariant measure takes a certain exponential form if and only if the "reflection vector field" satisfies some appropriate skew symmetry condition. In addition vector fields satisfying this condition are characterized, various examples are given and the extension to convex polyhedral domains---important for applications to queueing theory---is studied.},

The main results of the paper are the following. The scaled workload imbalance process under the Harrison-Wein policy converges weakly to a two-sided regulator applied to Brownian motion. The Harrison-Wein policy is asymptotically optimal in the following sense. Let $U_1^r(t)$ denote the cumulative idleness incurred by server 1 up to time $t$ in the network with population level $r$. Then under the Harrison-Wein policy the limit $\lim_{r\to\infty}EU_1^r(r^2T)/(rT)$ exists and is finite for fixed and large $T$. Furthermore that limit is not greater than for any other policy.},

The present work establishes two results for such networks. The first result is a formula of the dimension of any workload process. The formula is proven under the usual assumptions of an open stochastic processing network in heavy traffic. The second result deals with the possible choices of a workload process which are infinite but of the same dimension. A canonical choice reduces the possibilities to a finite number. Sufficient conditions beyond those already existing are provided for the canonical choice to be valid and to yield a nonnegative workload process.},

The concept of flow relaxation is introduced and is used to transform the optimal routing problem into an initial flow optimization problem with convex cost and linear constraints. Three algorithms are given for open-loop computation of the optimal initial flow. The first is a simple iterative algorithm based on gradient descent with bending, and it is well suited for decentralized computation. The second algorithm reduces the problem to a series of maximum flow problems, and it computes the exact optimal initial flow in 0(/N/4) computations where /N/ is the number of nodes in the network. The third algorithm is based on a search for successive bottlenecks in the network},

	Abstract = {
	We study different notions of capacity for time-slotted ALOHA systems. In these systems, multiple users synchronously send packets in a bursty manner over a common additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The users do not coordinate their transmissions, which may collide at the receiver. For such a system, we define both single-slot capacity and multiple-slot capacity. We then construct a coding and decoding scheme for single-slot capacity that achieves any rate within this capacity region. This coding and decoding scheme for a single time slot combines aspects of multiple access rate splitting and of broadcast codes for degraded AWGN channels. This design allows some bits to be reliably received even when collisions occur and more bits to be reliably received in the absence of collisions. The exact number of bits reliably received under both of these scenarios is part of the code design process, which we optimize to maximize the expected rate in each slot. Next, we examine the behavior of the system asymptotically over multiple slots. We show that there exist coding and decoding strategies such that regardless of the burstiness of the traffic, the system is stable as long as the average rate of the users is within the multiple access capacity region of the channel. In other words, we show that bursty traffic does not decrease the Cover-Wyner capacity region of the multiple access channel. A vast family of codes, which includes the type of codes we introduce for the single-slot transmission, achieve the capacity region, in a sense we define, for multiple-slot transmissions. These codes are stabilizing, using only local information at each of the individual queues. The use of information regarding other queues or the use of scheduling does not improve the multiple-slot capacity region.},

	Abstract = {Control-synthesis techniques are developed for demand-driven production systems. The resulting policies are time-optimal for a deterministic model, and approximately time-optimal for a stochastic model. Moreover, they are easily adapted to take into account a range of issues that arise in a realistic, dynamic environment. In particular, control synthesis techniques are developed for models in which resources are temporarily unavailable. This may be due to failure, maintenance, or an unanticipated change in demand. These conclusions are based upon the following development. i) Workload models are investigated for demand-driven systems, and an associated workload-relaxation is introduced as an approach to model-reduction. ii) The impact of hard constraints on performance, and on optimal control solutions is addressed via Lagrange multiplier techniques. These include deadlines and buffer constraints. iii) Rules for choosing appropriate safety-stocks as well as hedging-points are described to ensure robustness of control solutions with respect to persistent disturbances, such as variability in demand and yield},

	Abstract = {It is well known that a local stability in any site of a multiclass queueing network (more precisely, the condition $\rho_j<1$ for all $j$, where $\rho_j$ is the load in the site $j$) does not guarantee the global stability of the network (i.e. the positive recurrency of the relevant {Markov} process). However, the global stability is ensured for a particular class of the so-called Kelly network. Not suprisingly, these facts are manifested in the non-trivial behaviour of a rather general network in the heavy traffic limit (HTL). An important concept in this context is the state space collapse (SSC) which means that customers in the different classes at a station occur (asymptotically) in fixed proportions. The author studies a somewhat weaker concept of multiplicative state space collapse (MSSC). More precisely, $$\frac{\|Z-\Delta W\|_T}{\max(\|W\|_T,1)}\to 0$$ as the traffic in the network increases. Here $Z$ and $W$ are the processes of the customer numbers and waiting times constructed on $[0,T]$ in the fluid model approximation, $\| \cdot \|_T$ is the uniform norm over $[0,T]$ and $\Delta$ is an appropriate "lifting" linear map. The fluid model approximation means that in the queueing network equations, the input flows, the customer service times and routing indicators are substituted by the relevant mean values. Moreover, the process $W$ converges in the HTL to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM).},

	Abstract = {This paper concerns control and performance evaluation for stochastic network models. Structural properties of value functions are developed for controlled Brownian motion (CBM) and deterministic (fluid) workload-models, leading to the following conclusions: Outside of a null-set of network parameters, the following hold. The fluid value-function is a smooth function of the initial state. Under further minor conditions, the fluid value-function satisfies the derivative boundary conditions that are required to ensure it is in the domain of the extended generator for the CBM model. Exponential ergodicity of the CBM model is demonstrated as one consequence. The fluid value-function provides a shadow function for use in simulation variance reduction for the stochastic model. The resulting simulator satisfies an exact large deviation principle, while a standard simulation algorithm does not satisfy any such bound. The fluid value-function provides upper and lower bounds on performance for the CBM model. This follows from an extension of recent linear programming approaches to performance evaluation.},

	Abstract = { 
	Let the set of nodes $P_1,\cdots,P_n$ of a finite graph be given, and for $i,j=1,\cdots,n$ let $c_{ij}$ be a nonnegative integer denoting the capacity of the directed arc $(P_iP_j)$. The problem of determining the maximal flow (of an homogeneous commodity conserved at nodes) through the graph from the source $P_1$ to the sink $P_n$ is that of finding $x_{ij}$ such that $0\leq x_{ij}\leq c_{ij} (i,j=1,\cdots,n)$, $\sum_{j=1}^n(x_{ij}-x_{ji})=0 (i=2,\cdots,n)$, and such that $\sum_jx_{1j}$ is maximized. 
	
	The authors presented earlier [same J.  8 (1956), 399--404; MR 18, 56] a combinatorial algorithm for solving this problem in the case of a planar graph. This paper gives an algorithm for the case of a general graph, and employs it in a further algorithm for the solution of the ordinary transportation problem: Minimizing the "cost" $\sum_{i,j}C_{ij}x_{ij}$ of flow through a graph whose nodes consist only of sources and sinks having specified flows and which has only arcs of the form $(P_iQ_j)$, where $P_i$ is a source, $Q_j$ a sink, $C_{ij}$ is the cost of transportation from $P_i$ to $Q_j$, and $x_{ij}$ is the corresponding flow to be determined. 
	
	Proofs for these procedures are given here in full; a detailed description of the efficient use of the transportation algorithm is given elsewhere [Management Sci.  3 (1956), 24--32]. This procedure is now the most commonly used for problems of this class.},

	Abstract = {The determination of the maximal steady flow in certain transportation networks can be formalized as follows. A graph $G$ is a finite collection of vertices $a,b,\cdots$, and arcs joining them. A positive capacity is assigned each arc of $G$. A chain joining the vertices $a$ and $h$ is a set of distinct arcs which can be arranged as $(ab),(bc),\cdots,(gh)$, where the vertices are distinct. A chain flow from $a$ to $b$ is a chain from $a$ to $b$ and a nonnegative number $k$ representing the flow along the chain from $a$ to $b$. A flow from $a$ to $b$ is a collection of chain flows from $a$ to $b$ such that the sum of the $k$'s for the chains that contain each arc does not exceed the capacity of that arc. A collection $D$ of arcs which meets every chain from $a$ to $b$ is a disconnecting set with value $v(D)$ equal to the sum of the capacities of its members; an irreducible disconnecting set is a cut. A graph is $ab$-planar if, together with arc $(ab)$, it is planar; i.e. can be drawn in the plane without crossing of arcs. Theorem 1: the maximum flow from $a$ to $b$ is the minimum of $v(D)$ over all disconnecting sets $D$. Theorem 2: an $ab$-planar graph contains a chain joining $a$ and $b$ that meets every cut precisely once. A specialized computing procedure for obtaining maximal flows (a problem in the general category of linear programming) can be based on these theorems.

@article{taywil93a,
	Abstract = {This work is concerned with the existence and uniqueness of a class of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions which live in the nonnegative orthant of $\bbfR\sp d$. Loosely speaking, such a process has a semimartingale decomposition such that in the interior of the orthant the process behaves like a Brownian motion with a constant drift and covariance matrix, and at each of the $(d-1)$-dimensional faces that form the boundary of the orthant, the bounded variation part of the process increases in a given direction (constant for any particular face) so as to confine the process to the orthant. For historical reasons, this ``pushing'' at the boundary is called instantaneous reflection. {\it M. I. Reiman} and {\it R. J. Williams} [ibid. 77, No. 1, 87-97 (1988; Zbl 0617.60081)] proved that a necessary condition for the existence of such a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) is that the reflection matrix formed by the directions of reflection be completely-${\cal S}$. We prove that this condition is sufficient for the existence of an SRBM and that the SRBM is unique in law. It follows from the uniqueness that an SRBM defines a strong {Markov} process. Our results have potential application to the study of diffusions arising as approximations to multiclass queueing networks.},

	Abstract = {In this work, the authors study a family of two-station queueing networks with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. A rigorous proof of the connection between the optimal sequencing problem for the two-station, two-customer-class queueing network and the problem of control of a multi-dimensional diffusion process is provided as a heavy traffic limit of the queueing problem. The goals are to represent the limit of the value functions for a sequence of queueing systems as the value function for a diffusion control problem and to use this representation to construct asymptotically optimal policies for the queueing systems. The analysis is based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and uses the theory of viscosity solutions of the HJB equation.

@article{fle01a,
	Abstract = {In the 1960s, Ford and Fulkerson introduced flows over time to add time to the standard network flow model. Since then, flows over time have been used widely to model network-structured, decision-making problems over time: problems in electronic communication, production and distribution, economic planning, cash flow, job scheduling, and transportation.
	
	A maximum flow over time generalizes standard maximum flow by introducing a time component. The objective is to send as much flow from source to sink in $T$ time units as possible, where capacities are interpreted as an upper bound on the rate of flow entering an arc. A related problem is the universally maximum flow, which is to send a flow from source to sink that maximizes the amount of flow arriving at the sink by time $t$ simultaneously for all $t\le T$. The author considers a further generalization of this problem that allows arc and node capacities to change over time. In particular, given a network with $m$ arcs and $n$ nodes, arc and node capacities that are piecewise constant functions of time with at most $k$ breakpoints and a time bound $T$, she shows how to compute a flow that maximizes the amount of flow reaching the sink in all time intervals $(0,t]$ simultaneously for all $0<t\le T$, in $O(k^2mn\log(kn^{2/m})$ time. The best previous algorithm requires $O(nk)$ maximum-flow computations on a network with $(m+n)k$ arcs and $nk$ nodes. The author's algorithm improves on this by a factor of $O(nk)$.},

	Abstract = {We consider a queueing network with two single-server stations and two types of customers. Customers of type A require service only at station 1 and customers of type B require service first at station 1 and then at station 2. Each server has a different general service time distribution, and each customer type has a different general interarrival time distribution. The problem is to find a dynamic sequencing policy at station 1 that minimizes the long-run average expected number of customers in the system.
	The scheduling problem is approximated by a dynamic control problem involving Brownian motion. A reformulation of this control problem is solved, and the solution is interpreted in terms of the queueing system in order to obtain an effective sequencing policy. Also, a pathwise lower bound (for any sequencing policy) is obtained for the total number of customers in the network. We show via simulation that the relative difference between the performance of the proposed policy and the pathwise lower bound becomes small as the load on the network is increased toward the heavy traffic limit.},

	Abstract = {A single machine produces several different classes of items in a make-to-stock mode. We consider the problem of scheduling the machine to regulate finished goods inventory, minimizing holding and backorder, or holding and lost sales costs. Demands are Poisson, service times are exponentially distributed, and there are no delays or costs associated with switching products. A scheduling policy dictates whether the machine is idle or busy and specifies the job class to serve in the latter case. Since the optimal solution can be numerically computed only for problems with several products, our goal is to develop effective policies that are computationally tractable for a large number of products. We develop index policies to decide which class to produce, including Whittle's "restless bandit" index, which possesses a certain asymptotic optimality. Several idleness policies are derived, and the best policy is obtained from a heavy traffic diffusion approximation. Nine sample problems are considered in a numerical study, and the average suboptimality of the best policy is less than 3%.

	Abstract = {Let $Z(t), W(t), Y(t)$ be descriptive processes which measure congestion and delay in an open multiclass queueing network. Here $Z=(Z(t), t\geq0)$ is the so-called queue length process, $W=(W(t),\ t\geq0)$ is the workload process and $Y=(Y(t), t\geq0)$ is the cumulative idletime process. These processes are related to the processes $E, A$ and $D$, the so-called external, internal arrival and departure processes by model equations. The long-time behaviour of the network can be described by fluid scaling or diffusion scaling. In the fluid scaling of descriptive processes the time is accelerated by a factor $r^2$, say the rescaled external process is defined by $\overline E{}^r(t)=r^{-2}E^r(r^2t)$. In the diffusion scaling the rescaled process has the form $\hat E{}^r(t)=r^{-1}(E^r(r^2t)-\alpha^rr^2t)$. Substituting these processes into model equations leads to the fluid and diffusion scaled equations. The main results of the paper represent the functional central limit theorem for the diffusion scaled processes under the heavy traffic conditions: $(\hat W{}^r,\hat X{}^r,\hat Y{}^r,\hat Z{}^r)\to(W,X,Y,Z)$ as $r\to\infty$. Here the customers' numbers process $Z=\Delta W$ where $\Delta$ is the relevant linear operator and $(W,X,Z)$ satisfy the usual relations like $W=X+RY$ a.s. and $W$ is the semimartingale reflected Brownian motion (SRBM) associated with the data $(S,\theta,\Gamma,R,\nu)$. Here $\theta=R\gamma$ and $\Gamma=RHR'$ are the drift and covariance of the limiting diffusion and other parameters are defined in a conventional way.},

	Abstract = {In a recent work it is shown that importance sampling can be avoided in the particle filter through an innovation structure inspired by traditional nonlinear filtering combined with optimal control formalisms. The resulting algorithm is referred to as feedback particle filter. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative study of the feedback particle filter (FPF). Two types of comparisons are discussed: i) with the extended Kalman filter, and ii) with the conventional resampling-based particle filters. The comparison with Kalman filter is used to highlight the feedback structure of the FPF. Also computational cost estimates are discussed, in terms of number of operations relative to EKF. Comparison with the conventional particle filtering approaches is based on a numerical example taken from the survey article on the topic of nonlinear filtering [2]. Comparisons are provided for both computational cost and accuracy. A secondary purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of the FPF algorithm, that can aid practitioners to rapidly implement the algorithm. A detailed algorithm (pseudo-code) is included, and compared against an EKF algorithm. Such comparisons also help highlight the feedback structure of the FPF algorithm.extended Kalman filter,},

	Abstract = {The feedback particle filter was created to avoid the complex and problem-dependent ``resampling'' that arises in other particle filter formulations. Practical implementation of this approach to nonlinear filtering requires an approximation of the innovations gain. It is known that this gain has a representation as the gradient to the solution to a version of Poisson's equation. This paper introduces a new approach to approximating the gradient with minimum mean-square error within a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) setting. The input to the new algorithm is the particles generated by the filter, and its output is a direct approximation to the gain; that is, the approximation of the gradient of the solution of Poisson's equation is obtained directly, without differentiation. The approach is based on two key ideas: reformulating the mean-square loss so that its dependence on the true solution to Poisson's equation is removed, and applying a recent variation of RKHS theory that allows for derivatives in the loss function. The methodology is illustrated with numerical experiments.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning belongs to a class of artificial intelligence algorithms which can be used to design adaptive optimal controllers learned online. These methods have mostly been based on state feedback, which limits their application in practical scenarios. In this paper, we present an output feedback Q-learning algorithm to solve the discrete-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. An output feedback Q-learning scheme is proposed that learns the optimal controller online without requiring any knowledge of system dynamics, making it completely model-free. Both policy iteration (PI) and value iteration (VI) algorithms are developed, where the later does not require an initially stabilizing policy. The convergence of these algorithms has been shown. The proposed method does not require a discounting factor which is typically introduced in the cost function to trade-off between the excitation noise bias and system stability. The method is therefore exact and converges to the actual LQR control solution obtained by solving the Riccati equation. Simulation results have been used to show the effectiveness of the scheme.},

	Abstract = {A general methodology is introduced for the construction and effective application of control vari{\^a}tes to estimation problems involving data from reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. We propose the use of a specific class of functions as control vari{\^a}tes, and we introduce a new consistent estimator for the values of the coefficients of the optimal linear combination of these functions. For a specific Markov chain Monte Carlo scenario, the form and proposed construction of the control vari{\^a}tes is shown to provide an exact solution of the associated Poisson equation. This implies that the estimation variance in this case (in the central limit theorem regime) is exactly zero. The new estimator is derived from a novel, finite dimensional, explicit representation for the optimal coefficients. The resulting variance reduction methodology is primarily (though certainly not exclusively) applicable when the simulated data are generated by a random-scan Gibbs sampler. Markov chain Monte Carlo examples of Bayesian inference problems demonstrate that the corresponding reduction in the estimation variance is significant, and that in some cases it can be quite dramatic. Extensions of this methodology are discussed and simulation examples are presented illustrating the utility of the methods proposed. All methodological and asymptotic arguments are rigorously justified under essentially minimal conditions.},

	Abstract = {The distributed computation of Nash equilibria is assuming growing relevance in engineering where such problems emerge in the context of distributed control. Accordingly, we present schemes for computing equilibria of two classes of static stochastic convex games complicated by a parametric misspecification, a natural concern in the control of large-scale networked engineered system. In both schemes, players learn the equilibrium strategy while resolving the misspecification: 1) Monotone stochastic Nash games: We present a set of coupled stochastic approximation schemes distributed across agents in which the first scheme updates each agent's strategy via a projected (stochastic) gradient step, whereas the second scheme updates every agent's belief regarding its misspecified parameter using an independently specified learning problem. We proceed to show that the produced sequences converge in an almost sure sense to the true equilibrium strategy and the true parameter, respectively. Surprisingly, convergence in the equilibrium strategy achieves the optimal rate of convergence in a mean-squared sense with a quantifiable degradation in the rate constant; 2) Stochastic Nash-Cournot games with unobservable aggregate output: We refine 1) to a Cournot setting where we assume that the tuple of strategies is unobservable while payoff functions and strategy sets are public knowledge through a common knowledge assumption. By utilizing observations of noise-corrupted prices, iterative fixed-point schemes are developed, allowing for simultaneously learning the equilibrium strategies and the misspecified parameter in an almost sure sense.},

	Abstract = {We develop a general method to prove the existence of spectral gaps for Markov semigroups on Banach spaces. Unlike most previous work, the type of norm we consider for this analysis is neither a weighted supremum norm nor an {\L}${}^{p}\text{-type}$ norm, but involves the derivative of the observable as well and hence can be seen as a type of 1-Wasserstein distance. This turns out to be a suitable approach for infinite-dimensional spaces where the usual Harris or Doeblin conditions, which are geared toward total variation convergence, often fail to hold. In the first part of this paper, we consider semigroups that have uniform behavior which one can view as the analog of Doeblin's condition. We then proceed to study situations where the behavior is not so uniform, but the system has a suitable Lyapunov structure, leading to a type of Harris condition. We finally show that the latter condition is satisfied by the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, even in situations where the forcing is extremely degenerate. Using the convergence result, we show that the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations' invariant measures depend continuously on the viscosity and the structure of the forcing.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The use of Lyapunov conditions for proving functional inequalities was initiated in [5]. It was shown in [4,30] that there is an equivalence between a Poincar{\'e} inequality, the existence of some Lyapunov function and the exponential integrability of hitting times. In the present paper, we close the scheme of the interplay between Lyapunov conditions and functional inequalities by*showing that strong functional inequalities are equivalent to Lyapunov type conditions;*showing that these Lyapunov conditions are characterized by the finiteness of generalized exponential moments of hitting times. We also give some complement concerning the link between Lyapunov conditions and integrability property of the invariant probability measure and as such transportation inequalities, and we show that some ``unbounded Lyapunov conditions'' can lead to uniform ergodicity, and coming down from infinity property.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper we introduce and investigate the notion of uniformly integrable operators on Lp(E, μ). Its relations to classical compactness and hypercontractivity are exhibited. Several consequences of this notion are established, such as Perron-- Frobenius type theorems, independence on p of the spectral radius in Lpp, continuity of spectral radius, and especially the existence of spectral gap in the irreducible case. We also present some infinitesimal criteria ensuring the uniform integrability of a positive semigroup or of its resolvent. For a μ-essentially irreducible Markov process, we show that the uniform integrability in Lp(μ) of some type of resolvent associated with the transition semigroup implies the large deviation principle of level-3 with some rate function given by a modified Donsker--Varadhan entropy functional. We also prove that the uniform integrability condition becomes even necessary in the symmetric case. Finally, we present several applications of our results to Feynman--Kac semigroups, to the thermodynamical limits of grand ensembles, and to (non-symmetric) Markov processes given by Girsanov's formula.},

	Abstract = {Two fundamental concepts and quantities, realization factors and performance potentials, are introduced for Markov processes. The relations among these two quantities and the group inverse of the infinitesimal generator are studied. It is shown that the sensitivity of the steady-state performance with respect to the change of the infinitesimal generator can be easily calculated by using either of these three quantities and that these quantities can be estimated by analyzing a single sample path of a Markov process. Based on these results, algorithms for estimating performance sensitivities on a single sample path of a Markov process can be proposed. The potentials in this paper are defined through realization factors and are shown to be the same as those defined by Poisson equations. The results provide a uniform framework of perturbation realization for infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) and non-IPA approaches to the sensitivity analysis of steady-state performance; they also provide a theoretical background for the PA algorithms developed in recent years},

	Abstract = {The authors develop a theory characterizing optimal stopping times for discrete-time ergodic Markov processes with discounted rewards. The theory differs from prior work by its view of per-stage and terminal reward functions as elements of a certain Hilbert space. In addition to a streamlined analysis establishing existence and uniqueness of a solution to Bellman's equation, this approach provides an elegant framework for the study of approximate solutions. In particular, the authors propose a stochastic approximation algorithm that tunes weights of a linear combination of basis functions in order to approximate a value function. They prove that this algorithm converges (almost surely) and that the limit of convergence has some desirable properties. The utility of the approximation method is illustrated via a computational case study involving the pricing of a path dependent financial derivative security that gives rise to an optimal stopping problem with a 100-dimensional state space},

	Abstract = {We consider the minimization of a convex objective function defined on a Hilbert space, which is only available through unbiased estimates of its gradients. This problem includes standard machine learning algorithms such as kernel logistic regression and least-squares regression, and is commonly referred to as a stochastic approximation problem in the operations research community. We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence of two well-known algorithms, stochastic gradient descent (a.k.a.~Robbins-Monro algorithm) as well as a simple modification where iterates are averaged (a.k.a.~Polyak-Ruppert averaging). Our analysis suggests that a learning rate proportional to the inverse of the number of iterations, while leading to the optimal convergence rate in the strongly convex case, is not robust to the lack of strong convexity or the setting of the proportionality constant. This situation is remedied when using slower decays together with averaging, robustly leading to the optimal rate of convergence. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations on synthetic and standard datasets.},

	Abstract = {We consider the stochastic approximation problem where a convex function has to be minimized, given only the knowledge of unbiased estimates of its gradients at certain points, a framework which includes machine learning methods based on the minimization of the empirical risk. We focus on problems without strong convexity, for which all previously known algorithms achieve a convergence rate for function values of O(1/n‾‾√). We consider and analyze two algorithms that achieve a rate of O(1/n) for classical supervised learning problems. For least-squares regression, we show that averaged stochastic gradient descent with constant step-size achieves the desired rate. For logistic regression, this is achieved by a simple novel stochastic gradient algorithm that (a) constructs successive local quadratic approximations of the loss functions, while (b) preserving the same running time complexity as stochastic gradient descent. For these algorithms, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the generalization error (in expectation, and also in high probability for least-squares), and run extensive experiments showing that they often outperform existing approaches.},

Both the algorithms are adapted to the samples and do not require approximation of the probability distribution as an intermediate step. The paper contains a preliminary error analysis for the algorithms as well as some comparative numerical results for a non-Gaussian distribution.

	Abstract = {Optimal choice of actions is a fundamental problem relevant to fields as diverse as neuroscience, psychology, economics, computer science, and control engineering. Despite this broad relevance the abstract setting is similar: we have an agent choosing actions over time, an uncertain dynamical system whose state is affected by those actions, and a performance criterion that the agent seeks to optimize. Solving problems of this kind remains hard, in part, because of overly generic formulations. Here, we propose a more structured formulation that greatly simplifies the construction of optimal control laws in both discrete and continuous domains. An exhaustive search over actions is avoided and the problem becomes linear. This yields algorithms that outperform Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning, and thereby solve traditional problems more efficiently. Our framework also enables computations that were not possible before: composing optimal control laws by mixing primitives, applying deterministic methods to stochastic systems, quantifying the benefits of error tolerance, and inferring goals from behavioral data via convex optimization. Development of a general class of easily solvable problems tends to accelerate progress---as linear systems theory has done, for example. Our framework may have similar impact in fields where optimal choice of actions is relevant.},

	Abstract = {We consider the stochastic shortest path problem, a classical finite-state Markovian decision problem with a termination state, and we propose new convergent Q-learning algorithms that combine elements of policy iteration and classical Q-learning/value iteration. These algorithms are related to the ones introduced by the authors for discounted problems in Bertsekas and Yu (Math. Oper. Res. 37(1):66-94, 2012). The main difference from the standard policy iteration approach is in the policy evaluation phase: instead of solving a linear system of equations, our algorithm solves an optimal stopping problem inexactly with a finite number of value iterations. The main advantage over the standard Q-learning approach is lower overhead: most iterations do not require a minimization over all controls, in the spirit of modified policy iteration. We prove the convergence of asynchronous deterministic and stochastic lookup table implementations of our method for undiscounted, total cost stochastic shortest path problems. These implementations overcome some of the traditional convergence difficulties of asynchronous modified policy iteration, and provide policy iteration-like alternative Q-learning schemes with as reliable convergence as classical Q-learning. We also discuss methods that use basis function approximations of Q-factors and we give an associated error bound.},

	Abstract = {Value functions arise as a component of algorithms as well as performance metrics in statistics and engineering applications. Computation of the associated Bellman equations is numerically challenging in all but a few special cases. A popular approximation technique is known as Temporal Difference (TD) learning. The algorithm introduced in this paper is intended to resolve two well-known problems with this approach: In the discounted-cost setting, the variance of the algorithm diverges as the discount factor approaches unity. Second, for the average cost setting, unbiased algorithms exist only in special cases. It is shown that the gradient of any of these value functions admits a representation that lends itself to algorithm design. Based on this result, the new differential TD method is obtained for Markovian models on Euclidean space with smooth dynamics. Numerical examples show remarkable improvements in performance. In application to speed scaling, variance is reduced by two orders of magnitude},

As in other versions of the particle filter, Monte Carlo methods are used to generate and propagate a set of particles, based on the underlying model. The system is designed so that the empirical distribution of the particles approximates the posterior distribution. In contrast to other approaches, particles are propagated as a controlled system using a gain function that is similar in nature to the Kalman gain for linear Gaussian systems. The FPF gain is obtained as a solution to a version of Poisson's equation. Approximation techniques are required, since the FPF gain has no closed-form solution.},

	Abstract = {The steady-state behavior a finite-state Markov chain can be evaluated by solving a Poisson equation, a special case of the optimality equation arising in average cost Markov decision processes. In practice, solving the Poisson equation is typically no easier than evaluating steady state behavior directly using the invariant probability mass function of the Markov chain. However, it is known that approximate solutions to the Poisson equation can be used to produce bounds on steady state performance and to accelerate simulations for estimating steady state behavior. In this paper we study the special structure taken on by the Poisson equation when the associated Markov chain is reversible. In particular, we show that reversible Markov chains have a special form of the Poisson equation that admits a closed form solution. As an application of the reversible Poisson equation we consider the construction of control variates that can be used in Markov chain-based samplers. We show one class of control variates that are obtained by approximating the known solution to the reversible Poisson equation, and demonstrate the application of these control variates on an example involving the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we look for feedbacks that minimize the sensitivity function of a linear single-variable feedback system represented by its frequency responses. Sensitivity to disturbances and robustness under plant perturbations are measured in a weighted H^{\infty } norm. In an earlier paper, Zames proposed an approach to feedback design involving the measurement of sensitivity by "multiplicative seminorms," which have certain advantages over the widely used quadratic norm in problems where there is plant uncertainty, or where signal power-spectra are not fixed, but belong to sets. The problem was studied in a general setting, and some H^{\infty } examples were solved. Here, a detailed study of the single-variable case is undertaken. The results are extended to unstable plants, and explicit formulas for the general situation of a finite number of right half-plane (RHP) plant zeros or poles are provided. The Q or "approximate-inverse" parametrization of feedbacks that maintain closed-loop stability is extended to the ease of unstable plants. The H^{\infty } and Wiener-Hopf approaches are compared.},

@article{hoaber07,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to illuminate the critical role of system zeros in control-system performance for the benefit of a wide audience both inside and outside the control systems community. Zeros are a fundamental aspect of systems and control theory; however, the causes and effects of zeros are more subtle than those of poles. In particular, positive zeros can cause initial undershoot (initial error growth), zero crossings, and overshoot in the step response of a system, whereas nonminimum-phase zeros limit bandwidth. Both of these aspects have real-world implications in many applications. Nonminimum-phase zeros exacerbate the tradeoff between the robustness and achievable performance of a feedback control system. From a control-theoretic point of view, a nonminimum-phase zero in the loop transfer function L is arguably the worst feature a system can possess. Every feedback synthesis methodology must accept limitations due to the presence of open-right-half-plane zeros, and the mark of a good analysis tool is the ability to capture the performance limitations arising from nonminimum-phase zeros.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We establish explicit socially optimal rules for an irreversible investment decision with time-to-build and uncertainty. Assuming a price sensitive demand function with a random intercept, we provide comparative statics and economic interpretations for three models of demand (arithmetic Brownian, geometric Brownian, and the Cox--Ingersoll--Ross). Committed capacity, that is, the installed capacity plus the investment in the pipeline, must never drop below the best predictor of future demand, minus two biases. The discounting bias takes into account the fact that investment is paid upfront for future use; the precautionary bias multiplies a type of risk aversion index by the local volatility. Relying on the analytical forms, we discuss in detail the economic effects. For example, the impact of volatility on the optimal investment is negligible in some cases. It vanishes in the \{CIR\} model for long delays, and in the \{GBM\} model for high discount rates. },

	Abstract = {This paper concerns the construction of tests for universal hypothesis testing problems, in which the alternate hypothesis is poorly modeled and the observation space is large. The mismatched universal test is a feature-based technique for this purpose. In prior work it is shown that its finite-observation performance can be much better than the (optimal) Hoeffding test, and good performance depends crucially on the choice of features. The contributions of this paper include: (i) We obtain bounds on the number of ε-distinguishable distributions in an exponential family. (ii) This motivates a new framework for feature extraction, cast as a rank-constrained optimization problem. (iii) We obtain a gradient-based algorithm to solve the rank-constrained optimization problem and prove its local convergence.},

	Abstract = {We provide an analytical comparison between discounted and average reward temporal-difference (TD) learning with linearly parameterized approximations. We first consider the asymptotic behavior of the two algorithms. We show that as the discount factor approaches 1, the value function produced by discounted TD approaches the differential value function generated by average reward TD. We further argue that if the constant function---which is typically used as one of the basis functions in discounted TD---is appropriately scaled, the transient behaviors of the two algorithms are also similar. Our analysis suggests that the computational advantages of average reward TD that have been observed in some prior empirical work may have been caused by inappropriate basis function scaling rather than fundamental differences in problem formulations or algorithms.},

The main contribution is the development of a feedback control-based transformation of the Wonham filter, where the control input is realized via a time-modulated Poisson counter process. A complete characterization of the feedback mechanism that defines the FPF is obtained, which leads to tractable algorithms for the nonlinear filtering problem even for large state spaces. Numerical examples are introduced to help illustrate the application of these techniques.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers an online (real-time) control problem that involves an agent performing a discrete-time random walk over a finite state space. The agent's action at each time step is to specify the probability distribution for the next state given the current state. Following the setup of Todorov, the state-action cost at each time step is a sum of a state cost and a control cost given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the agent's next-state distribution and that determined by some fixed passive dynamics. The online aspect of the problem is due to the fact that the state cost functions are generated by a dynamic environment, and the agent learns the current state cost only after selecting an action. An explicit construction of a computationally efficient strategy with small regret (i.e., expected difference between its actual total cost and the smallest cost attainable using noncausal knowledge of the state costs) under mild regularity conditions is presented, along with a demonstration of the performance of the proposed strategy on a simulated target tracking problem. A number of new results on Markov decision processes with KL control cost are also obtained.},

Approximations are comprised of linear combinations of fixed basis functions whose weights are incrementally updated during a single endless trajectory of the Markov chain. We present a proof of convergence (with probability 1) and a characterization of the limit of convergence. We also provide a bound on the resulting approximation error that exhibits an interesting dependence on the ``mixing time'' of the Markov chain. The results parallel previous work by the authors, involving approximations of discounted cost-to-go. },

	Abstract = {Control design for stochastic systems is traditionally based on optimization of the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. Despite the theoretical attractiveness of such a design methodology, its applicability is very limited owing to its computational overhead. Thus it is worthwhile to seek an alternative formulation resulting in a more tractable design. In this paper, an alternative is presented that leads to a simpler form of design equations. The proposed controller minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between the actual probabilistic descriptions of the closed-loop behaviour and the desired one. Its explicit randomized form depends on the solution of a functional equation with a simpler structure than that of the general dynamic programming equations. A basic paradigm is proposed, and the resulting algorithm is discussed. For illustration purposes, it is applied to linear Gaussian systems, and the desired result is obtained: The optimal controller is determined by a discrete-time Riccati equation.},

	Abstract = {Mean-field models are a popular tool in a variety of fields. They provide an understanding of the impact of interactions among a large number of particles or people or other ``self-interested agents'', and are an increasingly popular tool in distributed control. This paper considers a particular randomized distributed control architecture introduced in our own recent work. In numerical results it was found that the associated meanfield model had attractive properties for purposes of control. In particular, when viewed as an input-output system, its linearization was found to be minimum phase. In this paper we take a closer look at the control model. The results are summarized as follows: (i) The Markov Decision Process framework of Todorov is extended to continuous time models, in which the ``control cost'' is based on relative entropy. This is the basis of the construction of a family of Markovian generators, parameterized by a scalar ζ E R. (ii) A decentralized control architecture is proposed in which each agent evolves as a controlled Markov process. A central authority broadcasts a common control signal {ζt} to each agent. The central authority chooses {ζt} based on an aggregate scalar output of the Markovian agents. This is the basis of the mean field model. (iii) Provided the control-free system (with ζ 0) is a reversible Markov process, the following identity holds for the transfer function G obtained from the linearization, Re (G(jω)) = PSDY(ω) ≥ 0 ω E R , where the right hand side denotes the power spectral density for the output of any one of the individual Markov processes (with ζ 0).},

	Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to gain insight into the equations arising in nonlinear filtering, as well as into the feedback particle filter introduced in recent research. The analysis is inspired by the optimal transportation literature and by prior work on variational formulation of nonlinear filtering. The construction involves a discrete-time recursion based on the successive solution of minimization problems involving the so-called forward variational representation of the elementary Bayes' formula. The construction shows that the dynamics of the nonlinear filter may be regarded as a gradient flow, or a steepest descent, for a certain energy functional with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence pseudo-metric. The feedback particle filter algorithm is obtained using similar analysis. This filter is a controlled system, where the control is obtained via consideration of the first order optimality conditions for the variational problem. The filter is shown to be exact, i.e., the posterior distribution of the particle matches exactly the true posterior, provided the filter is initialized with the true prior.},

	Abstract = {Suppose that f is a function from Rk to Rk and for some $\theta$, f($\theta$) = 0. Initially f is unknown, but for any x in Rk we can observe a random vector Y(x) with expectation f(x). The unknown $\theta$ can be estimated recursively by Blum's (1954) multivariate version of the Robbins-Monro procedure. Blum's procedure requires the rather restrictive assumption that infimum of the inner product (x - $\theta$)tf(x) over any compact set not containing $\theta$ be positive. Thus at each x, f(x) gives information about the direction towards $\theta$. Blum's recursion is Xn+1 = Xn - an Yn where the conditional expectation of Yn given X1, ?, Xn is f(Xn) and $a_n > 0$ . Unlike Blum's method, the procedure introduced in this paper does not necessarily attempt to move in a direction that decreases |Xn - $\theta$|, at least not during the initial stage of the procedure. Rather, except for random fluctuations it moves in a direction which decreases |f|2, and it may follow a circuitous route to $\theta$. Consequently, it does not require that (x - $\theta$)tf(x) have a constant signum. This new procedure is somewhat similar to the multivariate Kiefer-Wolfowitz procedure applied to |f|2, but unlike the latter it converges to $\theta$ at rate n-1/2. Deterministic root finding methods are briefly discussed. The method of this paper is a stochastic analog of the Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Newton techniques.},

The results are: (i) The best achievable probability of error Pe decays as -log(Pe) = (n2/m)(1 + o(1))J for some J >; 0, shown by upper and lower bounds. (ii) A coincidence-based test has non-zero generalized error exponent J, and is optimal in the generalized error exponent of missed detection.

In the average-cost optimal control framework, the general model introduced in this paper reduces to a variant of the linear-programming representation of the average-cost optimal control problem, subject to an additional mutual information constraint on the randomized stationary policy. The resulting optimization problem is convex and admits a decomposition based on the Bellman error, which is the object of study in approximate dynamic programming. The structural results presented in this paper can be used to obtain performance bounds, as well as algorithms for computation or approximation of optimal policies.},

@article{yanmehmey13,
	Abstract = {The feedback particle filter introduced in this paper is a new approach to approximate nonlinear filtering, motivated by techniques from mean-field game theory. The filter is defined by an ensemble of controlled stochastic systems (the particles). Each particle evolves under feedback control based on its own state, and features of the empirical distribution of the ensemble. The feedback control law is obtained as the solution to an optimal control problem, in which the optimization criterion is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the actual posterior, and the common posterior of any particle. The following conclusions are obtained for diffusions with continuous observations: 1) The optimal control solution is exact: The two posteriors match exactly, provided they are initialized with identical priors. 2) The optimal filter admits an innovation error-based gain feedback structure. 3) The optimal feedback gain is obtained via a solution of an Euler-Lagrange boundary value problem; the feedback gain equals the Kalman gain in the linear Gaussian case. Numerical algorithms are introduced and implemented in two general examples, and a neuroscience application involving coupled oscillators. In some cases it is found that the filter exhibits significantly lower variance when compared to the bootstrap particle filter.},

The resulting feedback particle filter (FPF) offers significant variance improvements; in particular, the algorithm can be applied to systems that are not stable. The filter comes with an up-front computational cost to obtain the filter gain. This paper describes new representations and algorithms to compute the gain in the general multivariable setting. The main contributions are, (i) Theory surrounding the FPF is improved: Consistency is established in the multivariate setting, as well as well-posedness of the associated PDE to obtain the filter gain. (ii) The gain can be expressed as the gradient of a function, which is precisely the solution to Poisson's equation for a related MCMC diffusion (the Smoluchowski equation). This provides a bridge to MCMC as well as to approximate optimal filtering approaches such as TD-learning, which can in turn be used to approximate the gain. (iii) Motivated by a weak formulation of Poisson's equation, a Galerkin finite-element algorithm is proposed for approximation of the gain. Its performance is illustrated in numerical experiments.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show how insight obtained from a mean-field model can be used to create an architecture for approximate dynamic programming (ADP) for a certain class of games comprising of a large number of agents. The general technique is illustrated with the aid of a mean-field oscillator game model introduced in our prior work. The states of the model are interpreted as the phase angles for a collection of nonhomogeneous oscillators, and in this way the model may be regarded as an extension of the classical coupled oscillator model of Kuramoto. The paper introduces ADP techniques for design and adaptation (learning) of approximately optimal control laws for this model. For this purpose, a parameterization is proposed, based on an analysis of the mean-field PDE model for the game. In an offline setting, a Galerkin procedure is introduced to choose the optimal parameters while in an online setting, a steepest descent algorithm is proposed. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the optimal parameter values as well as the Bellman error with both the Galerkin approximation and the online algorithm. Finally, a phase transition result is described for the large population limit when each oscillator uses the approximately optimal control law. A critical value of the control penalty parameter is identified: above this value, the oscillators are incoherent; and below this value (when control is sufficiently cheap) the oscillators synchronize. These conclusions are illustrated with results from numerical experiments.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we investigate the competitive interaction between electrical vehicles or hybrid oil-electricity vehicles in a Cournot market consisting of electricity transactions to or from an underlying electricity distribution network. We provide a mean field game formulation for this competition, and introduce the set of fundamental differential equations ruling the behavior of the vehicles at the feedback Nash equilibrium, referred here to as the mean field equilibrium. This framework allows for a consistent analysis of the evolution of the price of electricity as well as of the instantaneous electricity demand in the power grid. Simulations precisely quantify those parameters and suggest that significant reduction of the daily electricity peak demand can be achieved by appropriate electricity pricing.},

	Abstract = {The small sample universal hypothesis testing problem is investigated in this paper, in which the number of samples n is smaller than the number of possible outcomes m. The goal of this paper is to find an appropriate criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting. A suitable model for analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both n and m increase to infinity, and n=o(m). A new performance criterion based on large deviations analysis is proposed and it generalizes the classical error exponent applicable for large sample problems (in which m=O(n)). This generalized error exponent criterion provides insights that are not available from asymptotic consistency or central limit theorem analysis. The following results are established for the uniform null distribution: 1) The best achievable probability of error Pe decays as Pe=exp{-(n2/m) J (1+o(1))} for some J > 0. 2) A class of tests based on separable statistics, including the coincidence-based test, attains the optimal generalized error exponents. 3) Pearson's chi-square test has a zero generalized error exponent and thus its probability of error is asymptotically larger than the optimal test.},

We give bounds on the difference of the rewards and an algorithm for deriving an approximating solution to the Markov decision process from a solution of the HJB equations. We illustrate the method on three examples pertaining, respectively, to investment strategies, population dynamics control and scheduling in queues.

The objective of the modeling is to express dynamics in terms of the so-called phase variables. For nonlinear estimation, a coupled-oscillator feedback particle filter is introduced. The filter is based on the construction of a large population of oscillators with mean-field coupling. The empirical distribution of the population encodes the posterior distribution of the phase variables. The methodology is illustrated with two numerical examples.},

An adaptive dead-time compensator is developed which is substantially different to the standard Smith predictor, and more generally applicable in practice. A framework is developed for selecting the controller parameters using now standard design techniques such as μ-synthesis. It is argued that adaptation allows for exact set point matching without the need for integration in the control law. Stability and convergence results are established for the resulting closed-loop system equations. The proposed adaptive dead-time compensator is compared with both a standard robust controller and an adaptive pole placement controller through experiments on a gas metal arc welding testbed},

	Abstract = {The task of the binary classification problem is to determine which of two distributions has generated a length-n test sequence. The two distributions are unknown; two training sequences of length N, one from each distribution, are observed. The distributions share an alphabet of size m, which is significantly larger than n and N. How does N,n,m affect the probability of classification error? We characterize the achievable error rate in a high-dimensional setting in which N,n,m all tend to infinity, under the assumption that probability of any symbol is O(m-1). The results are: 1) There exists an asymptotically consistent classifier if and only if m = o(min{N2, Nn}). This extends the previous consistency result in [1] to the case N ≠ n. 2) For the sparse sample case where max{n, N} = o(m), finer results are obtained: The best achievable probability of error decays as - log(Pe) = J min {N2, Nn}(1 +o(1))/m with J >; 0. 3) A weighted coincidence-based classifier has non-zero generalized error exponent J. 4) The l2-norm based classifier has J = 0.},

The generalized error exponent based on large deviation analysis was proposed to characterize the performance of tests, using the high-dimensional model in which both n and m tend to infinity and n = o(m). In previous work, the best achievable probability of error is shown to decay -log(Pe) = (n2/m)(1 + o(1))J with upper and lower bounds on J. However, there is a significant gap between the two bounds. In this paper, we close the gap by proving a tight upper-bound, which matches the lower-bound over the entire region of generalized error exponents of false alarm and missed detection, achieved by the coincidence-based test. This implies that the coincidence-based test is asymptotically optimal.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to understand phase transition in noncooperative dynamic games with a large number of agents. Applications are found in neuroscience, biology, and economics, as well as traditional engineering applications. The focus of analysis is a variation of the large population linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) model of Huang et al. 2007, comprised here of a controlled N-dimensional stochastic differential equation model, coupled only through a cost function. The states are interpreted as phase angles for a collection of heterogeneous oscillators, and in this way the model may be regarded as an extension of the classical coupled oscillator model of Kuramoto. A deterministic PDE model is proposed, which is shown to approximate the stochastic system as the population size approaches infinity. Key to the analysis of the PDE model is the existence of a particular Nash equilibrium in which the agents "opt out' of the game, setting their controls to zero, resulting in the "incoherence' equilibrium. Methods from dynamical systems theory are used in a bifurcation analysis, based on a linearization of the partial differential equation (PDE) model about the incoherence equilibrium. A critical value of the control cost parameter is identified: above this value, the oscillators are incoherent; and below this value (when control is sufficiently cheap) the oscillators synchronize. These conclusions are illustrated with results from numerical experiments.},

	Abstract = {It is known that state-dependent, multi-step Lyapunov bounds lead to greatly simplified verification theorems for stability for large classes of Markov chain models. This is one component of the ``fluid model'' approach to stability of stochastic networks. In this paper we extend the general theory to randomized multi-step Lyapunov theory to obtain criteria for stability and steady-state performance bounds, such as finite moments. These results are applied to a remote stabilization problem, in which a controller receives measurements from an erasure channel with limited capacity. Based on the general results in the paper it is shown that stability of the closed loop system is assured provided that the channel capacity is greater than the logarithm of the unstable eigenvalue, plus an additional correction term. The existence of a finite second moment in steady-state is established under additional conditions.},

	Abstract = {We argue that the spectral theory of non-reversible Markov chains may often be more effectively cast within the framework of the naturally associated weighted- L ∞ space $${L_\infty^V}$$ , instead of the usual Hilbert space L 2 = L 2 (π), where π is the invariant measure of the chain. This observation is, in part, based on the following results. A discrete-time Markov chain with values in a general state space is geometrically ergodic if and only if its transition kernel admits a spectral gap in $${L_\infty^V}$$ . If the chain is reversible, the same equivalence holds with L 2 in place of $${L_\infty^V}$$ . In the absence of reversibility it fails: There are (necessarily non-reversible, geometrically ergodic) chains that admit a spectral gap in $${L_\infty^V}$$ but not in L 2 . Moreover, if a chain admits a spectral gap in L 2 , then for any $${h\in L_2}$$ there exists a Lyapunov function $${V_h\in L_1}$$ such that V h dominates h and the chain admits a spectral gap in $${L_\infty^{V_h}}$$ . The relationship between the size of the spectral gap in $${L_\infty^V}$$ or L 2 , and the rate at which the chain converges to equilibrium is also briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {Perfect sampling is a technique that uses coupling arguments to provide a sample from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain in a finite time without ever computing the distribution. This technique is very efficient if all the events in the system have monotonicity property. However, in the general (non-monotone) case, this technique needs to consider the whole state space, which limits its application only to chains with a state space of small cardinality. Here, we propose a new approach for the general case that only needs to consider two trajectories. Instead of the original chain, we use two bounding processes (envelopes) and we show that, whenever they meet, one obtains a sample under the stationary distribution of the original chain. We show that this new approach is particularly effective when the state space can be partitioned into pieces where envelopes can be easily computed. We further show that most Markovian queueing networks have this property and we propose efficient algorithms for some of them.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the sparse sample goodness-of-fit problem, where the number of samples $n$ is smaller than the size of the alphabet $m$. The goal of this work is to find an appropriate criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting. A suitable model for analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both $n$ and $m$ tend to infinity, and $n=o(m)$. We propose a new performance criterion based on large deviation analysis, which generalizes the classical error exponent applicable for large sample problems (in which $m=O(n)$). This new criterion provides insights that are not available from asymptotic consistency or CLT analysis. The main results are: 
(i) The best achievable probability of error $P_e$ decays as $-\log(P_e)=(n^2/m)(1+o(1))J$ for some $J>0$. 
(ii) A well-known coincidence-based test attains the optimal generalized error exponent. 
(iii) The widely used Pearson's chi-square test has J=0. 
(iv) The contributions (i)-(iii) are established under the assumption that the distribution under the null hypothesis is uniform. For the non-uniform case, a new test is proposed, with a non-zero generalized error exponent.

The Kullback-Leibler divergence rate is employed as a metric to measure the difference between the Markov model and its approximation. For a certain relaxation of the bi-partition model reduction problem, the solution is shown to be characterized by an associated eigenvalue problem. The form of the eigenvalue problem is closely related to the Markov spectral theory for model reduction. This result is the basis of a heuristic proposed for the m-ary partition problem, resulting in a practical recursive algorithm. The results are illustrated with examples.},

	Abstract = {The authors develop a theory characterizing optimal stopping times for discrete-time ergodic Markov processes with discounted rewards. The theory differs from prior work by its view of per-stage and terminal reward functions as elements of a certain Hilbert space. In addition to a streamlined analysis establishing existence and uniqueness of a solution to Bellman's equation, this approach provides an elegant framework for the study of approximate solutions. In particular, the authors propose a stochastic approximation algorithm that tunes weights of a linear combination of basis functions in order to approximate a value function. They prove that this algorithm converges (almost surely) and that the limit of convergence has some desirable properties. The utility of the approximation method is illustrated via a computational case study involving the pricing of a path dependent financial derivative security that gives rise to an optimal stopping problem with a 100-dimensional state space},

	Abstract = {A key question in the design of engineered competitive systems has been that of the efficiency of the associated equilibria. Yet, there is little known in this regard in the context of stochastic dynamic games in a large population regime. In this paper, we revisit a class of noncooperative games, arising from the synchronization of a large collection of homogeneous oscillators. In [1], we derived a PDE model for analyzing the associated equilibria in large population regimes through a mean field approximation. Here, we examine the efficiency of the associated mean-field equilibria with respect to a related welfare optimization problem. We construct variational problems both for the noncooperative game and its centralized counterpart and employ these problems as a vehicle for conducting this analysis. Using a bifurcation analysis, we analyze the variational solutions and the associated efficiency loss. An expression for the efficiency loss is obtained. Finally, our results are validated through detailed numerics.},

The optimal control is chosen so that the posterior distribution of a particle matches as closely as possible the posterior distribution of the true state, given the observations. In the infinite-N limit, the empirical distribution of ensemble particles converges to the posterior distribution of an individual particle. The cost function in this control problem is the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between the actual posterior, and the posterior of any particle. The optimal control input is characterized by a certain Euler-Lagrange (E-L) equation. A numerical algorithm is introduced and implemented in two general examples: A linear SDE with partial linear observations, and a nonlinear oscillator perturbed by white noise, with partial nonlinear observations.},

	Abstract = {A key question in the design of engineered competitive systems has been that of the efficiency of the associated equilibria. Yet, there is little known in this regard in the context of stochastic dynamic games in a large population regime. In this paper, we revisit a class of noncooperative games, arising from the synchronization of a large collection of homogeneous oscillators. In [1], we derived a PDE model for analyzing the associated equilibria in large population regimes through a mean field approximation. Here, we examine the efficiency of the associated mean-field equilibria with respect to a related welfare optimization problem. We construct variational problems both for the noncooperative game and its centralized counterpart and employ these problems as a vehicle for conducting this analysis. Through such an avenue, an expression for the efficiency loss is obtained. Through a bifurcation analysis, we analyze the variational solutions and the associated efficiency loss. Finally, our results are validated through detailed numerics.},

	Abstract = {We consider the classical finite-state discounted Markovian decision problem, and we introduce a new policy iteration-like algorithm for finding the optimal Q-factors. Instead of policy evaluation by solving a linear system of equations, our algorithm involves (possibly inexact) solution of an optimal stopping problem. This problem can be solved with simple Q-learning iterations, in the case where a lookup table representation is used; it can also be solved with the Q-learning algorithm of Tsitsiklis and Van Roy [TsV99], in the case where feature-based Q-factor approximations are used. In exact/lookup table representation form, our algorithm admits asynchronous and stochastic iterative implementations, in the spirit of asynchronous/modified policy iteration, with lower overhead advantages over existing Q-learning schemes. Furthermore, for large-scale problems, where linear basis function approximations and simulation-based temporal difference implementations are used, our algorithm resolves effectively the inherent difficulties of existing schemes due to inadequate exploration.},

	Abstract = {For the universal hypothesis testing problem, where the goal is to decide between the known null hypothesis distribution and some other unknown distribution, Hoeffding proposed a universal test in the nineteen sixties. Hoeffding's universal test statistic can be written in terms of Kullback #x2013;Leibler (K-L) divergence between the empirical distribution of the observations and the null hypothesis distribution. In this paper a modification of Hoeffding's test is considered based on a relaxation of the K-L divergence, referred to as the mismatched divergence. The resulting mismatched test is shown to be a generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for the case where the alternate distribution lies in a parametric family of distributions characterized by a finite-dimensional parameter, i.e., it is a solution to the corresponding composite hypothesis testing problem. For certain choices of the alternate distribution, it is shown that both the Hoeffding test and the mismatched test have the same asymptotic performance in terms of error exponents. A consequence of this result is that the GLRT is optimal in differentiating a particular distribution from others in an exponential family. It is also shown that the mismatched test has a significant advantage over the Hoeffding test in terms of finite sample size performance for applications involving large alphabet distributions. This advantage is due to the difference in the asymptotic variances of the two test statistics under the null hypothesis.},

Existing theoretical results for RL give very little guidance on reasonable ways to perform exploration. In this paper, we examine the convergence of single-step on-policy RL algorithms for control. On-policy algorithms cannot separate exploration from learning and therefore must confront the exploration problem directly. We prove convergence results for several related on-policy algorithms with both decaying exploration and persistent exploration. We also provide examples of exploration strategies that can be followed during learning that result in convergence to both optimal values and optimal policies.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to understand phase transition in noncooperative dynamic games with a large number of agents. Applications are found in neuroscience, biology, economics, as well as traditional engineering applications. The focus of analysis is a variation of the large population LQG model of Huang et. al. 2007, comprised here of a controlled nonlinear N-dimensional stochastic differential equation model, coupled only through a nonlinear cost function. The states are interpreted as the phase angle for a collection of non-homogeneous oscillators, and in this way the model may be regarded as an extension of the classical coupled oscillator model of Kuramoto. A deterministic PDE model is proposed, which is shown to approximate the stochastic system as the population size approaches infinity. Key to the analysis of the PDE model is the existence of a particular Nash equilibrium in which the agents `opt out' of the game, setting their controls to zero, resulting in the `incoherence' equilibrium. Methods from dynamical systems theory are used in a bifurcation analysis, based on a linearization of the PDE model about the incoherence equilibrium. A critical value of the control cost parameter is identified: Above this value, the oscillators are incoherent; and below this value (when control is sufficiently cheap) the oscillators synchronize. These conclusions are illustrated with results from numerical experiments.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses model reduction for a Markov chain on a large state space. A simulation-based framework is introduced to perform state aggregation of the Markov chain based on observations of a single sample path. The Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence rate is employed as a metric to measure the distance between two stationary Markov chains. Model reduction with respect to this metric is cast as an infinite-horizon average cost optimal control problem. In this way an optimal policy corresponds to an optimal partition of the state space with respect to the K-L divergence rate. The optimal control problem is simplified in an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework: First, a relaxation of the policy space is performed, and based on this a parameterization of the set of optimal policies is introduced. This makes possible a stochastic approximation approach to compute the best policy within a given parameterized class. The algorithm can be implemented using a single sample path of the Markov chain. Convergence is established using the ODE method. Examples illustrate the theoretical results, and show remarkably low variance and fast convergence.},

	Abstract = {Prices in electricity markets are given by the dual variables
associated with the supply-demand constraint in the dispatch problem.
However, in unit-commitment-based day-ahead markets, these
variables are less easy to obtain. A common approach relies on resolving
the dispatch problem with 
the commitment decisions fixed and utilizing the associated dual
variables. Yet, this avenue leads to inadequate revenues to generators and necessitates an
{\em  uplift payment} to be made by the market operator.
Recently,  a {\em convex hull pricing} scheme has been proposed to
reduce the impact of such payments and requires the global maximization of
the associated Lagrangian dual problem, which is, in general, a
piecewise-affine concave function.  In this paper, we present a
pivot-based finite-termination procedure for obtaining such a global
maximizer. Unlike standard subgradient schemes where an arbitrary
subgradient is used, we present a novel technique
where the {\em steepest} ascent direction is constructed by solving a
continuous quadratic program. The
scheme initiates a move along this direction with an a priori constant
steplength, with the intent of reaching the boundary of the
face. A backtracking scheme allows for mitigating the impact of
excessively large steps. Termination of the scheme occurs when the set
of subgradients contains the zero vector. Preliminary numerical tests
are seen to be promising and display the finite-termination property.
Furthermore, the scheme is seen to significantly outperform standard
subgradient methods.},

	Abstract = {This paper concerns the construction of tests for universal hypothesis testing problems, in which the alternate hypothesis is poorly modeled and the observation space is large. The mismatched universal test is a feature-based technique for this purpose. In prior work it is shown that its finite-observation performance can be much better than the (optimal) Hoeffding test, and good performance depends crucially on the choice of features. The contributions of this paper include: (i) We obtain bounds on the number of #x03B5;-distinguishable distributions in an exponential family. (ii) This motivates a new framework for feature extraction, cast as a rank-constrained optimization problem.

@article{katvei87,
	Abstract = {The multi-armed bandit problem arises in sequentially allocating effort to one of N projects and sequentially assigning patients to one of N treatments in clinical trials. Gittins and Jones (1974) have shown that one optimal policy for the N-project problem, an N-dimensional discounted Markov decision chain, is determined by the following largest-index rule. There is an index for each state of each given project that depends only on the data of that project. In each period one allocates effort to a project with largest current index. The purpose of this paper is to give a short proof of this result and a new characterization of the index of a project in state i, viz., as the maximum expected present value in state i for the restart-in-i problem in which, in each state and period, one either continues allocating effort to the project or immediately restarts the project in state i. Moreover, it is shown that an approximate largest-index rule yields an approximately optimal policy. These results lead to more efficient methods of computing the indices on-line and/or for sparse transition matrices in large state spaces than have been suggested heretofore. By using a suitable implementation of successive approximations, a policy whose expected present value is within $\epsilon$ \% of the maximum possible range of values of the indices can be found on-line with at most (N + T - 1)TM operations where M is the number of operations required to calculate one approximation, T is the least integer majorizing the ratio ln $\epsilon$ /ln a and 0 < a < 1 is the discount factor.},

	Abstract = { Research on numerical solution methods for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) has primarily focused on finite-state models, and these algorithms do not generally extend to continuous-state POMDPs, due to the infinite dimensionality of the belief space. In this paper, we develop a computationally viable and theoretically sound method for solving continuous-state POMDPs by effectively reducing the dimensionality of the belief space via density projection. The density projection technique is also incorporated into particle filtering to provide a filtering scheme for online decision making. We provide an error bound between the value function induced by the policy obtained by our method and the true value function of the POMDP, and also an error bound between projection particle filtering and exact filtering. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our method through an inventory control problem. },

Close lower and upper bounds are established on the pattern redundancy of strings generated by Hidden {Markov} models (HMMs) with a small number of states, showing in particular that their per-symbol pattern redundancy diminishes with increasing string length.

	Abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) has emerged as one of the most popular approaches to classification and supervised learning. It is a flexible approach for solving the problems posed in these areas, but the approach is not easily adapted to noisy data in which absolute discrimination is not possible. We address this issue in this paper by returning to the statistical setting. The main contribution is the introduction of a statistical support vector machine (SSVM) that captures all of the desirable features of the SVM, along with desirable statistical features of the classical likelihood ratio test. In particular, we establish the following: (i) The SSVM can be designed so that it forms a continuous function of the data, yet also approximates the potentially discontinuous log likelihood ratio test. (ii) Extension to universal detection is developed, in which only one hypothesis is labeled (a semi-supervised learning problem). (iii) The SSVM generalizes the robust hypothesis testing problem based on a moment class. Motivation for the approach and analysis are each based on ideas from information theory. A detailed performance analysis is provided in the special case of i.i.d. observations.

	Abstract = {We study the problem of robust quickest change detection where the pre-change and post-change distributions are not known exactly but belong to known uncertainty classes of distributions. Both Bayesian and minimax versions of the quickest change detection problem are considered. When the uncertainty classes satisfy some specific conditions, we identify least favorable distributions (LFD's) from the uncertainty classes, and show that the detection rule designed for the LFD's is optimal in a minimax sense. The condition is similar to that required for the existence of LFD's for the robust hypothesis testing problem studied by Huber.},

	Abstract = {Q-learning is a technique used to compute an optimal policy for a controlled Markov chain based on observations of the system controlled using a non-optimal policy. It has proven to be effective for models with finite state and action space. This paper establishes connections between Q-learning and nonlinear control of continuous-time models with general state space and general action space. The main contributions are summarized as follows. (i) The starting point is the observation that the "Q-function" appearing in Q-learning algorithms is an extension of the Hamiltonian that appears in the minimum principle. Based on this observation we introduce the steepest descent Q-learning algorithm to obtain the optimal approximation of the Hamiltonian within a prescribed function class, (ii) A transformation of the optimality equations is performed based on the adjoint of a resolvent operator. This is used to construct a consistent algorithm based on stochastic approximation that requires only causal filtering of observations, (iii) Several examples are presented to illustrate the application of these techniques, including application to distributed control of multi-agent systems},

	Abstract = {
The main goal of filtering is to obtain, recursively in time, good estimates of the state of a stochastic dynamical system based on noisy partial observations of the same. In settings where the signal/observation dynamics are significantly nonlinear or the noise intensities are high, an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which is essentially a first order approximation to an infinite dimensional problem, can perform quite poorly: it may require very frequent re-initializations and in some situations may even diverge. The theory of nonlinear filtering addresses these difficulties by considering the evolution of the conditional distribution of the state of the system given all the available observations, in the space of probability measures. We survey a variety of numerical schemes that have been developed in the literature for approximating the conditional distribution described by such stochastic evolution equations; with a special emphasis on an important family of schemes known as the particle filters. A numerical study is presented to illustrate that in settings where the signal/observation dynamics are non linear a suitably chosen nonlinear scheme can drastically outperform the extended Kalman filter.},

	Abstract = {For Markov sources, the structure of optimal causal encoders minimizing the total communication rate subject to a mean-square distortion constraint is studied. The class of sources considered lives in a continuous alphabet, and the encoder is allowed to be variable-rate. Both the finite-horizon and the infinite-horizon problems are considered. In the finite-horizon case, the problem is non-convex, whereas in the infinite-horizon case the problem can be convexified under certain assumptions. For a finite horizon problem, the optimal deterministic causal encoder for a kth-order Markov source uses only the most recent k source symbols and the information available at the receiver, whereas the optimal causal coder for a memoryless source is memoryless. For the infinite-horizon problem, a convex-analytic approach is adopted. Randomized stationary quantizers are suboptimal in the absence of common randomness between the encoder and the decoder. If there is common randomness, the optimal quantizer requires the randomization of at most two deterministic quantizers. In the absence of common randomness, the optimal quantizer is non-stationary and a recurrence-based time-sharing of two deterministic quantizers is optimal. A linear source driven by Gaussian noise is considered. If the process is stable, innovation coding is almost optimal at high-rates, whereas if the source is unstable, then even a high-rate time-invariant innovation coding scheme leads to an unstable estimation process},

It is similar to the Gaussian mixture model in which the actual marginal distribution is used in place of a Gaussian distribution. This structure leads to simple learning algorithms to find an optimal model. (ii) The OFP model provides a unification of other modeling approaches including the projective methods of Shannon, Mori and Zwanzig, and Chorin, as well as a version of the binning technique for {Markov} model reduction. (iii) Several general applications are surveyed, including inference and optimal control. Computation of the spectrum, or solutions to dynamic programming equations are possible through a finite dimensional matrix calculation without knowledge of the underlying marginal distribution on which the model is based.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the graph associated with a binary Ising {Markov} random field. We describe a method based on ℓ1-regularized logistic regression, in which the neighborhood of any given node is estimated by performing logistic regression subject to an ℓ1-constraint. The method is analyzed under high-dimensional
scaling, in which both the number of nodes p and maximum neighborhood size d are allowed to grow as a function of the number of observations n. Our main results provide sufficient conditions on the triple (n, p, d) and the model parameters for the method to succeed in consistently estimating the neighborhood of every node in the graph simultaneously. With coherence conditions imposed on the population Fisher information matrix, we prove that consistent neighborhood selection can be obtained for sample sizes n =(d3 log p), with exponentially decaying error. When these same conditions are imposed directly on the sample matrices, we show that a reduced sample size of n =
(d2 log p) suffices for the method to estimate neighborhoods consistently. Although this paper focuses on the binary graphical models, we indicate how a generalization of the method of the paper would apply to general discrete {Markov} random fields.

	Abstract = {Let $x_1,\cdots,x_r$ be $r$ random variables whose joint probability density function $f(x_1,\cdots,x_r,\theta_1,\cdots,\theta_k)$ is assumed known except for the values of the parameters $\theta_1,\cdots,\theta_k$. The author considers the general problem of testing hypotheses about the values of $\theta_1,\cdots,\theta_k$ when the number of independent observations approaches infinity. A hypothesis $H_\omega$ that the point $\theta=\theta_1,\cdots,\theta_k$ lies in a given subset $\omega$ of the parameter space $\Omega$ is tested on the basis of $n$ independent observations on $x_1,\cdots,x_r$ as follows. A critical region (subset) $W_n$ of the $rn$-dimensional sample space is chosen and the hypothesis is rejected if and only if the observed sample point lies in the critical region $W_n$.Let $P(W_n|\theta)$ denote the probability that the sample point will fall in $W_n$ when $\theta$ is the parameter point. The author considers the following three definitions of ``best'' critical regions. (I) Let $F$ be a given family of surfaces in the parameter space such that each element of $F$ lies entirely in the complement $\overline\omega$ of $\omega$. Let $w(\theta)$ be a given nonnegative ``weight'' function defined over the entire parameter space. A critical region $W_n$ is said to have uniformly best average power with respect to the family $F$ of surfaces and the weight function $w(\theta)$ if $$ \int_{F_0}P(W_n|\theta)w(\theta)dA\geq\int_{F_0}P(Z_n|\theta)w(\theta)dA $$ for any element $F_0$ of $F$ and for any region $Z_n$ of the $rn$-dimensional sample space for which $$ \underset\theta\in\omega\to{\text{l.u.b.}}P(Z_n|\theta)=\underset\theta\in\omega\to{\text{l.u.b.}}P(W_n|\theta). $$ (II) Let $F$ be as before. A critical region $W_n$ for testing $H_\omega$ is said to have uniformly best constant power on the family $F$ if (a) $P(W_n|\theta)$ is constant over each element of $F$; (b) if $Z_n$ satisfies (a) and the condition $$ \underset\theta\in\omega\to{\text{l.u.b.}}P(Z_n|\theta)=\underset\theta\in\omega\to{\text{l.u.b.}}P(W_n|\theta), $$ then $P(W_n|\theta)\geq P(Z_n|\theta)$ for any $\theta$ not in $\omega$. (III) Denote by $P_n(\theta,\omega,\alpha)$ the l.u.b. of $P(Z_n|\theta)$ with respect to $Z_n$ subject to the condition that $\text{l.u.b.}_{\theta\in\omega}P(Z_n|\theta)=\alpha$, a preassigned constant. A critical region $W_n$ is said to give a most stringent test of $H_\omega$ if, for some positive $\alpha$, $\text{l.u.b.}_{\theta\in\omega}P(W_n|\theta)=\alpha$ and $$ \underset\theta\in\overline\omega\to{\text{l.u.b.}}\,{P_n(\theta,\omega,\alpha)-P(W_n|\theta)\}\leq\underset\theta\in\overline\omega\to{\text{l.u.b.}}\,{P_n(\theta,\omega,\alpha)-P(Z_n|\theta)} $$ for all regions $Z_n$ for which $\text{l.u.b.}_{\theta\in\omega}P(Z_n|\theta)=\alpha$.

One of the main results obtained is the following. Under certain restrictions on the density function $f$ and on $H_\omega$ the Neyman-Pearson likelihood ratio test is asymptotically ``best'' in the sense of each of the three definitions. The family $F$ and weight function $w(\theta)$ with respect to which the likelihood ratio test has asymptotically best average and asymptotically best constant power are of relatively simple structure. The author also derives the limiting form of the power function of the likelihood ratio test when the number of observations approaches infinity.

@book{wil62,
	Abstract = {important book is, in the author's own words, intended to introduce mathematical statistics to readers with good undergraduate backgrounds in mathematics. In the reviewer's opinion, it is hardly an introductory book, but certainly an excellent text-book on an advanced level, and most likely to become a valuable source of reference for research workers in theoretical as well as applied statistics.

The following condensed list of the contents will give a general idea of the scope of the book: (1--5) Probabilistic prerequisites: probability measures, distribution functions, means and moments, random sequences, characteristic functions; (6--7) Special distributions; (8--9) Sampling theory: exact and asymptotic; (10--11) Estimation: linear, nonparametric, parametric; (13--14) Testing parametric and nonparametric hypotheses; (15) Sequential analysis; (16) Decision functions; (17) Time series; (18) Multivariate statistical theory.

No less than 411 exercises are offered; they are largely selected from original papers and partly serve to introduce additional material. There are nineteen pages of references at the end of the book, and plenty of bibliographical information in the text.

As the author states in his preface, he has tried to make a unified and systematic presentation of classical results of mathematical statistics, without going into too many ramifications. This he has accomplished with great skill. Among noteworthy features in the direction of systematization, the reviewer would like to mention the modern and stringent presentation in Chapters 1--5 of the fundamentals of probability; the theory of matrix sampling and of coverage distributions in Chapter 8; the method of randomization in Chapter 14; the brief and helpful introduction to spectral theory in Chapter 17; and the multivariate theory in Chapter 18, where the notion of scatter plays a unifying role.---The reader also finds many interesting pieces of knowledge from outside the beaten track, e.g., the finite-population version of many sampling problems; Hoeffding's results on symmetric functions of a sample; Halmos's symmetry argument for minimum variance estimators; the exact combinatorial formulas of Birnbaum and Tingey, Massey, Gnedenko and Korolink in the theory of confidence contours and confidence bands.

In view of the author's professed intention to make a selection in accordance with his own preferences and prejudices, it will be no criticism, but rather a piece of information for the reader, to list a few topics that could perhaps have been treated differently or more thoroughly. Experimental design receives very little attention. There is no mention of estimation by linear combination of order statistics. The common matrix and vector notation and ready-made matrix manipulations are used very little. The somewhat heavy multiparametric estimation and testing theory could have been made more intuitive through reference to the previously treated linear situation. In accordance with the general conservative program of the book, decision theory receives only a brief chapter.

The concise style, the carefully chosen notation, and the emphasis on mathematical methods, as opposed to statistical techniques, remind the reader of Cram{\'e}r's classical book [Mathematical methods of statistics,\/ Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, N.J., 1946; MR0016588 (8,39f)]. The author has more material and somewhat less philosophy. The details are sometimes complex; the totality is of appealing simplicity and homogeneity. },

We propose a method for modelling economic systems in which outcomes depend locally on the predictions that agents make of other agents. We develop populations games in which each agent adaptively searches for a good model of its environment. We demonstrate that such systems can exhibit persistent dynamics, cyclic oscillations between low and high complexity states, and other complex, yet endogenous, phenomena. We propose that these `adaptively rational' agents as a natural extension of rational expectations, suitable when mutual consistency is not realistic. We discuss the connections between our work and the programs of bounded rationality, evolutionary game theory, and models motivated by statistical mechanics.},

	Abstract = {The formalism of probabilistic graphical models provides a unifying framework for capturing complex dependencies among random variables, and building large-scale multivariate statistical models. Graphical models have become a focus of research in many statistical, computational and mathematical fields, including bioinformatics, communication theory, statistical physics, combinatorial optimization, signal and image processing, information retrieval and statistical machine learning. Many problems that arise in specific instances-including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions-are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, Graphical Models, Exponential Families and Variational Inference develops general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. It describes how a wide variety of algorithms- among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, and max-product-can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to {Markov} chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

	Abstract = {The martingale method is used to establish concentration inequalities for a class of dependent random sequences on a countable state space, with the constants in the inequalities expressed in terms of certain mixing coefficients. Along the way, bounds are obtained on martingale differences associated with the random sequences, which may be of independent interest. As applications of the main result, concentration inequalities are also derived for inhomogeneous {Markov} chains and hidden {Markov} chains, and an extremal property associated with their martingale difference bounds is established. This work complements and generalizes certain concentration inequalities obtained by Marton and Samson, while also providing different proofs of some known results.

	Abstract = {Approximate dynamic programming has been formulated and applied mainly to discrete-time systems. Expressing the ADP concept for continuous-time systems raises difficult issues related to sampling time and system model knowledge requirements. In this paper is presented a novel online adaptive critic (AC) scheme, based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP), to solve the infinite horizon optimal control problem for continuous-time dynamical systems; thus bringing together concepts from the fields of computational intelligence and control theory. Only partial knowledge about the system model is used, as knowledge about the plant internal dynamics is not needed. The method is thus useful to determine the optimal controller for plants with partially unknown dynamics. It is shown that the proposed iterative ADP algorithm is in fact a quasi-Newton method to solve the underlying algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) of the optimal control problem. An initial gain that determines a stabilizing control policy is not required. In control theory terms, in this paper is developed a direct adaptive control algorithm for obtaining the optimal control solution without knowing the system A matrix},

In this paper we propose a new scheme based on adaptive critics for finding online the state feedback, infinite horizon, optimal control solution of linear continuous-time systems using only partial knowledge regarding the system dynamics. In other words, the algorithm solves online an algebraic Riccati equation without knowing the internal dynamics model of the system. Being based on a policy iteration technique, the algorithm alternates between the policy evaluation and policy update steps until an update of the control policy will no longer improve the system performance. The result is a direct adaptive control algorithm which converges to the optimal control solution without using an explicit, a priori obtained, model of the system internal dynamics. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown while finding the optimal-load-frequency controller for a power system.},

In this paper two second-order algorithms for determining optimal control are derived using the notion of differential dynamic programming, which is also used to re-derive the well known second-variation method. This unified treatment allows the differences between the three algorithms to be studied in detail.

It is shown that the second-order algorithms are more accurate than the second-variation method and, moreover, that one of these algorithms is simpler to implement.

	Abstract = {We study the preconditioning of {Markov} chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods using coarse-scale models with applications to subsurface characterization. The purpose of preconditioning is to reduce the fine-scale computational cost and increase the acceptance rate in the MCMC sampling. This goal is achieved by generating {Markov} chains based on two-stage computations. In the first stage, a new proposal is first tested by the coarse-scale model based on multiscale finite volume methods. The full fine-scale computation will be conducted only if the proposal passes the coarse-scale screening. For more efficient simulations, an approximation of the full fine-scale computation using precomputed multiscale basis functions can also be used. Compared with the regular MCMC method, the preconditioned MCMC method generates a modified {Markov} chain by incorporating the coarse-scale information of the problem. The conditions under which the modified {Markov} chain will converge to the correct posterior distribution are stated in the paper. The validity of these assumptions for our application and the conditions which would guarantee a high acceptance rate are also discussed. We would like to note that coarse-scale models used in the simulations need to be inexpensive but not necessarily very accurate, as our analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate. We present numerical examples for sampling permeability fields using two-point geostatistics. The Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve expansion is used to represent the realizations of the permeability field conditioned to the dynamic data, such as production data, as well as some static data. Our numerical examples show that the acceptance rate can be increased by more than 10 times if MCMC simulations are preconditioned using coarse-scale models.'},

The algorithm approximates the differential cost function of a perturbed MDP via a linear combination of basis functions.

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop methods for model reduction for diffusion processes that exhibit cyclic behavior. For this purpose we extend techniques based on the spectral theory of {Markov} processes to the case of complex spectra. The main idea is to augment the state process for the diffusion with a clock process. For each complex eigenvalue for the original diffusion there exists a real eigenvalue for the augmented process. Results concerning metastability (or quasi-stationarity) are then applied to the augmented process. The results are illustrated through a linear diffusion, and an empirical model of combustion dynamics.},

	Abstract = { How do movements in the distribution of income and wealth affect the macroeconomy? We analyze this question using a calibrated version of the stochastic growth model with partially uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and movements in aggregate productivity. Our main finding is that, in the stationary stochastic equilibrium, the behavior of the macroeconomic aggregates can be almost perfectly described using only the mean of the wealth distribution. This result is robust to substantial changes in both parameter values and model specification. Our benchmark model, whose only difference from the representative-agent framework is the existence of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, displays far less cross-sectional dispersion and skewness in wealth than U.S. data. However, an extension that relies on a small amount of heterogeneity in thrift does succeed in replicating the key features of the wealth data. Furthermore, this extension features aggregate time series that depart significantly from permanent income behavior. },

	Abstract = {We develop explicit, general bounds for the probability that the normalized partial sums of a function of a {Markov} chain on a general alphabet would exceed the steady-state mean of that function by a given amount. Our bounds combine simple information-theoretic ideas together with techniques from optimization and some fairly elementary tools from analysis. In one direction, we obtain a general bound for the important class of Doeblin chains; this bound is optimal, in the sense that in the special case of independent and identically distributed random variables it essentially reduces to the classical Hoeffding bound. In another direction, motivated by important problems in simulation, we develop a series of bounds in a form which is particularly suited to these problems, and which apply to the more general class of "geometrically ergodic" {Markov} chains},

A shift from departmental labs to college labs is advocated for pedagogical, as well as financial, reasons. Because laboratories are a common resource to all departments, they can be funded at the college level and can be administered by faculty from the various engineering departments. This structure has been in place for ten years at Illinois and has proven to be an effective approach to undergraduate control systems education.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new property of {Markov} chains, called variance bounding. We prove that, for reversible chains at least, variance bounding is weaker than, but closely related to, geometric ergodicity. Furthermore, variance bounding is equivalent to the existence of usual central limit theorems for all L2 functionals. Also, variance bounding (unlike geometric ergodicity) is preserved under the Peskun order. We close with some applications to Metropolis--Hastings algorithms.

@article{wu04,
	Abstract = { Let $P(x,dy)$ be a {Markov} transition kernel on some Polish space $E$. We also regard $P$ as an operator on some Banach lattice $\Bbb B$. The lattices considered in the paper are (1) the space of measurable bounded functions on $E$, (2) the space of continuous bounded functions on $E$, and (3) the $L\sp p$-space on $E$ for some $p\in(1,\infty)$ with respect to some invariant probability measure. The main object of interest in the paper is the essential radius, $$r\sb{\rm ess}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})=\sup\{|\lambda|\colon \lambda\in\sigma \sb{\rm ess}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})\},$$ where $\sigma\sb{\rm ess}(P)$ denotes the Wolff essential spectrum, the set of $\lambda\in\Bbb C$ such that $\lambda-P$ is not a Fredholm operator. If $P$ is irreducible and aperiodic, then we have $r\sb{\rm ess}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})<1$ if and only if $r\sb{\exp}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})<1$, where $r\sb{\exp}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})$ is the supremum over all $|\lambda|\not=1$ with $\lambda$ in the usual spectrum of $P|\sb {\Bbb B}$.

In pioneering work in the 1930s, Doeblin proved the following sufficient criterion in the case where $\Bbb B$ is the space of measurable bounded functions on $E$: If $\sup\sb {A\subset\Bbb B\colon \nu(A)<\eta}P\sp N(x,A)<1$, for some $N\in\Bbb N$ and for some probability measure $\nu$ on $E$ and some $\eta>0$, then $r\sb{\exp}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})<1$. Other sufficient criteria proved by Doeblin are in terms of upper estimates of $Pu/u$ for a bounded measurable function $u\colon E\to[1,\infty)$ (called a drift condition), and in terms of exponential moments of hitting times of compact subsets for the associated {Markov} chain (called the geometric recurrence condition).

In the present paper, estimates for $r\sb{\rm ess}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})$ are given in terms of the above-mentioned criteria and in terms of other related objects, like a weighted supremum norm and, in the case where $\Bbb B$ is an $L\sp p$-space, the drift condition with unbounded function $u$. The main tools are two new measures of non-compactness, $\beta\sb \tau(P)$ and $\beta\sb w(P)$, and a new formula of Nussbaum-Gel\cprime fand type for $r\sb{\rm ess}(P|\sb {\Bbb B})$. No irreducibility or aperiodicity of $P$ is assumed. Moreover, it is proved that the Donsker-Varadhan large deviation principle for the associated {Markov} chain holds if and only if the essential spectral radius is zero. Furthermore, eigenvalues of $P$ on $L\sb 2$-space in the symmetric case are estimated, and geometric convergence rates in the Wasserstein metric for the convergence towards equilibrium are estimated. Some concrete examples are given.

For controlled countable {Markov} chains (MCs) and for controlled diffusions, the author proposes several equivalent conditions that ensure this set is compact, in particular: (a) a uniform integrability condition on some return time under stationary (or randomized stationary) policies for controlled MCs and under {Markov} policies for controlled diffusions, and (b) a stochastic {Lyapunov} condition.},

	Abstract = {Let {X/sub t/} be a stationary finite-alphabet {Markov} chain and {Z/sub t/} denote its noisy version when corrupted by a discrete memoryless channel. Let P(X/sub t//spl isin//spl middot/|Z/sub -/spl infin///sup t/) denote the conditional distribution of X/sub t/ given all past and present noisy observations, a simplex-valued random variable. We present a new approach to bounding the entropy rate of {Z/sub t/} by approximating the distribution of this random variable. This approximation is facilitated by the construction and study of a {Markov} process whose stationary distribution determines the distribution of P(X/sub t//spl isin//spl middot/|Z/sub -/spl infin///sup t/). To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we specialize it and derive concrete bounds for the case of a binary {Markov} chain corrupted by a binary symmetric channel (BSC). These bounds are seen to capture the behavior of the entropy rate in various asymptotic regimes.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores connections between Information Theory, {Lyapunov} exponents for products of random matrices, and hidden {Markov} models. Specifically, we will show that entropies associated with finite-state channels are equivalent to {Lyapunov} exponents. We use this result to show that the traditional prediction filter for hidden {Markov} models is not an irreducible {Markov} chain in our problem framework. Hence, we do not have access to many well-known properties of irreducible continuous state space {Markov} chains (e.g. a unique and continuous stationary distribution). However, by exploiting the connection between entropy and {Lyapunov} exponents and applying proof techniques from the theory of random matrix products we can solve abroad class of problems related to capacity and hidden {Markov} models. Our results provide strong regularity results for the non-irreducible prediction filter as well as some novel theoretical tools to address problems in these areas.},

This interesting paper is a survey of {Markov} chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for computing characteristics of posterior distributions. In particular, it discusses the Gibbs sampler, the Metropolis algorithm and some hybrid strategies. Results from the theory of general state space {Markov} chains are used to derive properties of these algorithms and to suggest improvements for some of them. Practical issues that arise in the implementation of MCMC methods are also discussed. Thus, on the one hand, the paper provides a sound theoretical basis for the use of MCMC algorithms in Bayesian inference and, on the other hand, it also gives valuable practical guidance. The discussion section is as important and interesting as the paper itself. The subjects treated include convergence issues, central limit theorems, hybrid algorithms, and numerical stability, among others.},

It is shown that with an appropriate choice of the threshold and window size, these GLR rules are asymptotically optimal. The rules are also extended to non-likelihood statistics that are widely used in monitoring adaptive algorithms for system identification and control by establishing Gaussian approximations to these statistics when the window size is chosen suitably. Recursive algorithms are developed for practical implementation of the procedure, and importance sampling techniques are introduced for determining the threshold of the rule to satisfy prescribed bounds on the false alarm rate},

	Abstract = {This is an expository paper on the use of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for bounding rates of convergence of {Markov} chains on finite state spaces to their stationary distributions. Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities complement eigenvalue techniques and work for nonreversible chains in continuous time. Some aspects of the theory simplify considerably with finite state spaces and we are able to give a self-contained development. Examples of applications include the study of a Metropolis chain for the binomial distribution, sharp results for natural chains on the box of side n in d dimensions and improved rates for exclusion processes. We also show that for most r-regular graphs the log-Sobolev constant is of smaller order than the spectral gap. The log-Sobolev constant of the asymmetric two-point space is computed exactly as well as the log-Sobolev constant of the complete graph on n points.

	Abstract = {This is a survey paper on {Markov} chains on general state spaces. The authors start with an introduction to {Markov} chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler. Examples of some applications to Bayesian statistics are also presented.

After this introductory material, the authors discuss some theoretical questions that arise in the context of MCMC algorithms such as the rate of convergence to stationarity, and present some sufficient conditions for geometric and uniform ergodicity of a {Markov} chain. In the next section, using coupling arguments, most of these results are proved.

Furthermore, MCMC central limit theorems, optimal scaling problems and weak convergence results are also presented.

It should be said that although there are no new results about {Markov} chains in this paper, many of the proofs are essentially new.

@article{kocree06,
	Abstract = {According to a 1975 result of T. Kaijser, if some nonvanishing product of
hidden {Markov} model (HMM) stepping matrices is subrectangular, and the
underlying chain is aperiodic, the corresponding $\alpha$-chain has a unique
invariant limiting measure $\lambda$. Here the $\alpha$-chain
$\{\alpha_n\}=\{(\alpha_{ni})\}$ is given by \[\alpha_{ni}=P(X_n=i|
Y_n,Y_{n-1},...),\] where $\{(X_n,Y_n)\}$ is a finite state HMM with unobserved
Markov chain component $\{X_n\}$ and observed output component $\{Y_n\}$. This
defines $\{\alpha_n\}$ as a stochastic process taking values in the probability
simplex. It is not hard to see that $\{\alpha_n\}$ is itself a {Markov} chain.
The stepping matrices $M(y)=(M(y)_{ij})$ give the probability that
$(X_n,Y_n)=(j,y)$, conditional on $X_{n-1}=i$. A matrix is said to be
subrectangular if the locations of its nonzero entries forms a cartesian
product of a set of row indices and a set of column indices. Kaijser's result
is based on an application of the Furstenberg--Kesten theory to the random
matrix products $M(Y_1)M(Y_2)... M(Y_n)$. In this paper we prove a slightly
stronger form of Kaijser's theorem with a simpler argument, exploiting the
theory of e chains.

In particular, we obtain a formula for the regular part simpler than a previous formula obtained by Schweitzer, and the singular part is obtained via a reduction process similar to Delebecque's reduction for the stationary distribution. In contrast to previous approaches, one works with aggregate {Markov} chains of much smaller dimension than the original chain, an essential feature for practical computation. An application to mean first-passage times is also presented.

	Abstract = {From the summary: "Let $\xi_0,\xi_1,\dots,\xi_{\omega-1} $ be observations from a hidden {Markov} model with probability distribution $ P^{\theta_0} $, and let $\xi_{\omega},\xi_{\omega+1},\dots$ be observations from the hidden {Markov} model with probability distribution $P^{\theta_1}$. The parameters ${\theta_0}$ and ${\theta_1}$ are given, while the change point $\omega$ is unknown. The problem is to raise an alarm as soon as possible after the distribution changes from $P^{\theta_0}$ to $P^{\theta_1}$, but to avoid false alarms.

"In this paper we investigate the performance of the Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak (SRP) rule for change point detection in the dynamic system of hidden {Markov} models. By making use of the {Markov} chain representation for the likelihood function, the structure of the asymptotically minimax policy of the Bayes rule, and sequential hypothesis testing theory for {Markov} random walks, we show that the SRP procedure is asymptotically minimax in the sense of M. Pollak \ref[Ann. Statist. 13 (1985), no. 1, 206--227; MR0773162 (86f:62137)]. Next, we present a second order asymptotic approximation for the expected stopping time when $\omega=1$. A nonlinear renewal theory for {Markov} random walks is also given."},

Specifically, we observe that the MEM is at least as powerful as a class of neural networks, in a sense that we make precise. Upper bounds on the approximation error are established for a wide class of target functions. The general theorem states that\break $\|f-f_n\|_p\le c/n^{r/d}$ for $f\in W_p^r(L)$ (a Sobolev class over $[-1,1]^d)$, and $f_n$ belongs to an $n$-dimensional manifold of normalized ridge functions. The same bound holds for the MEM as a special case of the above. The stochastic error, in the context of learning from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) examples, is also examined. An asymptotic analysis establishes the limiting behavior of this error, in terms of certain pseudo-information matrices. These results substantiate the intuition behind the MEM, and motivate applications."},

	Annote = {Semi-Markov decision processes with unbounded rewards are studied. The author gives the conditions for the existences of $\varepsilon$-optimal and optimal stationary policies in the case when the state space is countable or general. He also gives the relation between an optimality equation and an optimal policy. Queueing problems are mentioned as an application.

\{Reviewer's remark: The author does not impose any condition on the manner in which the set $A_x$ of actions feasible at state $x$ depends on $x$. This fact, in the case of general state space, leads to a crucial fault on the measurability of the optimal return over $n$-stages, and consequently it does the same over the infinite future. The author claims that if each $A_x$ is countable and if $\gamma(x,a)$ is Borel measurable in $(x,a)$, then $u(x)=\sup_{a\in A_x}\gamma(x,a)$ is Borel measurable. The reviewer, however, has a simple counterexample as follows. Consider the case when $\gamma$ is independent of $x$ and is given by $\gamma(x,a)=a$ for $a,x\inR^1$. Choose two real numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$ so that $a_1\neq a_2$, choose a non-Borel subset $S_1$ of $R^1$, and put $S_2=S_1{}^c$. Suppose that $A_x=\{a_1\}$ or $\{a_2\}$ depending on whether $x\in S_1$ or $S_2$. Then we have $u(x)=a_1$ or $a_2$ depending on whether $x\in S_1$ or $S_2$, which is not a Borel measurable function.\}

	Annote = {From the text: "S. A. Lippman [same journal 21 (1974/75), no. 11, 1225--1233; MR0398535 (53 \#2386)] considered a discounted semi-Markov decision process with general state space $S$ and action space $A$. Generalizing his approach of an earlier paper [ibid. 19 (1972/73), 717--731; MR0337340 (49 \#2109)], he presented sufficient conditions for the existence of a normed Banach space of real-valued functions on $S$ in which E. V. Denardo's $N$-stage contraction approach [SIAM Rev. 9 (1967), 165--177; MR0215608 (35 \#6448)] may be used. This approach allows the rewards of the {Markov} decision process to be unbounded to a certain extent. This is made possible by the specific choice of the norm in the Banach space. Lippman used weighted supremum norms which were later studied more generally for {Markov} decision processes by the second author [J. Math. Anal.

Author's summary: "In this paper stationary {Markov} decision problems are considered with an arbitrary state space and a compact space of strategies. Conditions are given for the existence of an average optimal strategy. This is done by using the fact that a continuous function on a compact space attains its minimum. To prove the continuity of the average cost as a function on the space of strategies some perturbation results for quasicompact linear operators are used. In a first set of conditions, the boundedness of the one-period cost functions and the quasicompactness of the {Markov} processes are assumed. In more general conditions the boundedness of the cost functions is replaced by the boundedness, on a subset $A$ of the state space, of the recurrence time and costs until $A$ and the quasicompactness of the {Markov} processes are replaced by the quasicompactness of the embedded {Markov} processes on $A$."},

	Abstract = {In optimal prediction methods one estimates the future behavior of underresolved systems by solving reduced systems of equations for expectations conditioned by partial data; renormalization group methods reduce the number of variables in complex systems through integration of unwanted scales. We establish the relation between these methods for systems in thermal equilibrium, and use this relation to find renormalization parameter flows and the coefficients in reduced systems by expanding conditional expectations in series and evaluating the coefficients by Monte-Carlo. We illustrate the construction by finding parameter flows for simple spin systems and then using the renormalized (=reduced) systems to calculate the critical temperature and the magnetization.

	Abstract = { It is well known that in estimating performance measures associated with a stochastic system a good importance sampling distribution (IS) can give orders of magnitude of variance reduction while a bad one may lead to large, even infinite, variance. In this paper we study how this sensitivity of the estimator variance to the importance sampling change of measure may be "dampened" by combining importance sampling with stochastic approximation based temporal difference (TD) method. We consider a finite state space discrete time {Markov} chain (DTMC) with one-step transition rewards and an absorbing set of states and focus on estimating the cumulative expected reward to absorption starting from any state. In this setting we develop sufficient conditions under which the estimate resulting from the combined approach has a mean square error that asymptotically equals zero even when the estimate formed by using only importance sampling change of measure has infinite variance. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the small buffer overflow probability in a queuing network, where the change of measure suggested in literature is shown to have infinite variance under certain parameters and where the appropriate combination of IS and TD method can be empirically seen to have a much faster convergence rate compared to naive simulation.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers a {Markov} decision process (MDP) that can be defined by a triplet $(\scr{S},\scr{A},{\rm P})$ where $\scr{S}$ and $\scr{A}$ are the state and the action spaces, respectively, and ${\rm P}$ is the transition probability, that is, ${\rm P}(s'|s,a)$ is the probability that the next state of the process is $s'$, given that the current state is $s$ and that action $a$ was taken. The spaces $\scr{S}$ and $\scr{A}$ are both finite. It is shown that, under a suitable communicating condition, the set of the MDP's limiting expected state-action frequencies (also known as state-action occupation measures) coincides with a polytope ${\rm X}$, defined as the set of probability measures $x$ on $\scr{S}\times\scr{A}$ that satisfy $$ \sum_s\sum_a {\rm P}(s'|s,a)x(s,a)=\sum_{a'} x(s',a') \quad\forall\;s'\in\scr{S}. $$ It is also shown that the probability of exceeding a given distance between the empirical frequency distribution and the polytope decays exponentially with time under every decision policy. Similar results are obtained for the empirical rewards},

	Abstract = {From the Publisher:
Singular perturbations and time-scale techniques were introduced to control engineering in the late 1960s and have since become common tools for the modeling, analysis, and design of control systems. In this SIAM Classics edition of the 1986 book, the original text is reprinted in its entirety (along with a new preface), providing once again the theoretical foundation for representative control applications.

This book continues to be essential in many ways. It lays down the foundation of singular perturbation theory for linear and nonlinear systems, it presents the methodology in a pedagogical way that is not available anywhere else, and it illustrates the theory with many solved examples, including various physical examples and applications. So while new developments may go beyond the topics covered in this book, they are still based on the methodology described here, which continues to be their common starting point.},

This condition, extending a condition introduced by Jarner and Roberts (2001) for polynomial convergence rates, turns out to be very convenient to prove subgeometric rates of convergence. Several applications are presented including nonlinear autoregressive models, stochastic unit root models and multidimensional random walk Hastings Metropolis algorithms.

Then the normalized partial sums $W_k(g)\coloneq k^{-1/2}\sum^{k-1}_{j=0}{g(X_j)-\pi(g)}$ satisfy a central limit theorem as $k\to\infty$, with error of order $k^{-1/2}$ with respect to Kolmogorov distance [E. Bolthausen, Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 60 (1982), no. 3, 283--289; MR0664418 (83j:60063)]. In this paper, under the stronger assumption of $V$-uniform ergodicity [S. P. Meyn and R. L. Tweedie, {Markov} chains and stochastic stability, Springer, London, 1993; MR1287609 (95j:60103)], it is shown that the $n$-th moment also converges, as long as $|g(x)-\pi(g)|\leq V(x)^{1/n}$ for all $x\in\scr X$, with an error bound for the approximation of $E_x{W^n_k(g)}$ of order $k^{-1/2}V(x)$.

	Abstract = {{This paper deals with policy evaluation algorithms within the
    framework of infinite-horizon dynamic programming problems with
    discounted cost. The authors consider the discrete-time stationary
    {Markov} chain with state space $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$ and the cost
    vector $J$, given by $$J(i)= E\Biggl[\sum^\infty_{t=0} \alpha^t
    g(i_t, i_{t+ 1})/i_0= i\Biggr],$$ $i= 1,2,\dots,n$, where $i_t$
    denotes the state of the system at time $t$. The authors discuss
    two methods to calculate $J$ approximately, using simulation,
    temporal difference and linear cost function approximation. The
    first method is a new algorithm, including the use of least square
    subproblems that are solved recursively and with a diminishing
    stepsize. The second method is the $\text{LSTD}(\lambda)$ algorithm,
    proposed by Boyan (to appear in Machine Learning). They state
    convergence results for these two algorithms.}},

@article{jon04a,
	Abstract = {

This is an excellent expository paper whose main goal is to describe conditions under which the {Central Limit Theorem} holds for certain {Markov} chains. To be precise, let $\bfmX=(X_{n})_{n\nat},\ N=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$, be a Harris ergodic {Markov} chain on a general measurable state space $(X,\bx)$ with invariant probability distribution $\pi$ on $\bx$ with support $X$.

Let $f$ be a real-valued $\bx$-measurable function on $X$. Define $\overline{f}_{n}=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(X_{i})$, $n\geq1$, and $E_{\pi}f=\int_{X}fd\pi$. If $E_{\pi}\vert f\vert<\infty$, then the ergodic theorem implies that $\overline{f_{n}}\rightarrow E_{\pi}f$ a.s. as $n\rightarrow\infty$. The conditions discussed refer to $X$ and $f$ in order to ensure that $\sqrt{n} (\overline{f}_{n}-E_{\pi}f)\overset d\to\rightarrow N(0,\sigma_{f}^{2})$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, where $\sigma_{f}^{2}=\colon{\rm var}_{\pi}\{f(X_{0})\}+2\sum_{n\geq1}{\rm cov}_{\pi} \{f(X_{0}),f(X_{n})\}<\infty$. This is done with a view towards {Markov} chain Monte Carlo settings, hence emphasis is on the connections between the drift and the mixing conditions, and their implications. The point is that when $X$ can be simulated, $\overline{f}_{n}$ is a natural estimate of $E_{\pi}f$. Then the validity of a {Central Limit Theorem} allows one to estimate $\sigma _{f}^{2}$ in order to decide whether $\overline{f}_{n}$ is a good estimate of $E_{\pi}f.$

\{Reviewer's remark: Another survey paper on the {Central Limit Theorem} for reversible {Markov} processes, which is not included in the references of the present paper, has been recently published by C. Landim \ref[in From classical to modern probability, 145--205, Birkh{\"a}user, Basel, 2003; MR2045987 (2005b:60055)].\}

@article{nel58,
	Abstract = { Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, let $C$ be the space of continuous functions on $X$, vanishing at $\infty$, and let $B$ be a linear space (with supremum norm) of bounded continuous functions on $X$, containing $C$. Let $P$ be a linear transformation of $B$ into itself, taking positive $(\geq 0)$ functions into positive functions, of norm $\leq 1$, with $P1=1$ if $X$ is compact, and suppose that for every positive $f$ in $B$ and every $x$ in $X$, $\sup_n\,(P^nf)(x)>0$. An existence theorem for linear functionals is proved implying that there is a regular measure $m$ on $X$ such that $mU>0$ if $U$ is open and not empty, and that $\int Pf\,dm\leq\int f\,dm$ if $f$ is positive and has compact support. A corresponding result for semigroups of transformations on $B$ is also obtained.

Now suppose that $X$ is any measurable space with the same structure as a Borel linear set. In the following, all measures are to be understood to be totally sigma finite. Let $p$ be a substochastic transition function: $p(x,\cdot )$ is a measure for each $x$; $p(\cdot,E)$ is measurable for each $E$; $p\leq 1$. If the integrals make sense, define $$ (Pf)(x)=\int f(y)p(x,dy),\quad(P^*\mu )(E)=\int p(x,E)d\mu (x). $$ If $P^*\mu \leq \mu $, $\mu $ is called `subinvariant', `invariant' if there is equality. If $p$ is substochastic, and if $m$ is a subinvariant measure, it is shown that $P$ is well-defined on $L^\alpha(m)$, and that $P^*f$ can be defined for $f$ in $L^1$ (and by extension to $L^\alpha$) as the Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to $m$ of $P^*\mu $, where $d\mu =fdm$. There is then a simple adjointness relationship between $P$ on $L^\alpha$ and $P^*$ on $L^\beta$, where $1/\alpha+1/\beta=1$. Moreover $P^*f$ is itself determined by a substochastic transition function $p^*$. If $$ \nu_x(E)=\sum_1^\infty2^{-n}p^n(x,E), $$ where $p^n$ is the $n$th iterate of the kernel $p$, and if $(*)$$\nu_x$ has the same null sets for every $x,p$ and $p^*$ are determined by transition densities which are a.e. transposes of each other.

Results on invariant measures are obtained which yield the following, with the help of a theorem of Harris [Proc. Third Berkeley Symposium Math. Statist. Probability, 1954--1955, vol. II, pp. 113--124, Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, 1956; MR0084889 (18,941d)]. If $p$ is substochastic, if $(*)$ is satisfied, if there is a point $x_0$ in $X$ with $\sum_1^\infty p^n(x_0,E)=\infty$ whenever $\nu_x(E)>0$, then there is an invariant measure $m$ with the same null sets as $\nu_x$, and such that every subinvariant measure is a multiple of $m$.

If $X$ is a differentiable manifold, and if there is a semigroup with infinitesimal generator a second order elliptic differential operator acting on functions on $X$, it is shown as an application that there is a unique invariant probability measure, and the adjoint semigroup is identified.},
